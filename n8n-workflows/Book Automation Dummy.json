The foundation grows; Cherry-picked cities of safety, schools and centers appear across the continent.

Myrtle bears a prophecy of a son who will lead humanity, while the couple’s private rites unfold in the House of Mystery far from prying eyes.

I would especially like to thank Edward\nArthur Wilson’s daughter, Margery Ellen Bell, for graciously\nsharing childhood memories of her father, and for the\nspirit in which she was willing to accept both the deeds and\nmisdeeds of a man she never really knew. Her friendship and\nencouragement have been deeply gratifying.\nI would also like to thank those former adherents and as-\nsociates of Brother XII who kindly shared details of their\nexperiences at the settlement; in particular, Eric Davenport,\nFrances Lucas, Herbert Jefferson, Alice Rudy, Dion Sepulveda,\nValea Sepulveda, and the numerous others whose accounts of\nevents were so essential to the narrative.\nIn Nanaimo, Stan Wardill was a cheerful source of infor-\nmation, as were the residents of Cedar-by-the-Sea, especially\nGeorge and Dolly Hygh, and John and Phyllis Murdoch.\nDonald M. Cunliffe generously provided material from his fa-\nther’s legal files, including the Robert England letter that is\nquoted in Chapter Five.\nI owe a debt of gratitude to Katherine McKelvie, widow of\nBruce McKelvie, for sharing the Brother XII material that her\n\nxii B R O T H E R X I I\nhusband had collected over the years. Harry Olsen and Cecil\nClark also provided valuable information. Ted Davy, former\nGeneral Secretary of the Theosophical Society in Canada and\neditor of \nThe Canadian Theosophist, read the manuscript and\noffered important suggestions. In addition, the members of\nThe Secret Doctrine class at Hermes Lodge in Vancouver made\nme welcome and helped me in my study of Theosophy, so\nvital to an understanding of Brother XII’s beliefs and activi-\nties. The Lodge library was a rich source of information and a\nsanctuary at times from the outside world.\nFor both advice and assistance during the course of the\nproject, I would particularly like to acknowledge Laura\nAnderson, Rick Baker, Vaughn Barclay, Morris Berman,\nChristopher Fortune, Neil Gilchrist, Erich Hoyt, Mark\nLaughlin, Adelle LaRouche, Esther Luk, Elliott McLaughlin,\nCorrine Nishi, Margaret Prang, James Santucci, Marion\nVan Berckel, Peter Vatcher, David Watmough, and George\nWoodcock. I would also like to thank Sheila Smyth, who played\na critical role in shaping the manuscript in its early stages, and\nPohsuan Zaide, whose perceptive editing contributed signifi-\ncantly to the final draft of the book.\nTo Douglas Gibson of McClelland & Stewart, I express my\nappreciation and respect. He believed in the book from its\ninception and guided it through its successive incarnations.\nLynn Schellenberg was a skillful and insightful editor whose\nsense of humour and positive attitude made her a pleasure to\nwork with. Literary agent Daniel Strone recognized the po-\ntential of the project and was an invaluable ally throughout.\nI’m also grateful to the Canada Council for its generous sup-\nport, particularly to Richard Holden, and to the Ontario Arts\nCouncil for some timely funding.\nAnd finally, I would like to thank my parents, Alice and\nColin Oliphant, for their steadfast support throughout the du-\nration of this project, although I’m sure they must have often\ndespaired of losing their son to Brother XII. To all who had a\npart in the making of this book, my sincere thanks.\n\nxiii\nPreface\nB\nritish Columbia’s Gulf Islands, nestled along the eastern\ncoastline of Vancouver Island, are renowned for their\nrugged natural beauty and Mediterranean climate, yet\nthey’re noteworthy for another reason as well—their lonely\nshores and secluded inlets are haunted by the spirit of a noto-\nrious cult leader known as Brother XII. The tales of gold, sex\nand black magic associated with his dictatorial reign over his\nisland kingdom have gripped people’s imaginations for years,\nthough when I first learned of the story little was known about\nthe man beyond the outlines of the legend that had sprung\nup around him and his flamboyant mistress, a whip-wielding\ndevotee of ritual magic with the pulp-fiction name of Madame\nZ.\nIntrigued by the tale, I set out to learn all that I could about\nBrother XII. In the years that followed, I tracked down and\ninterviewed surviving disciples, located rare documents that\nshed unprecedented light on the events that transpired at\nhis Aquarian Foundation, and investigated the mystery sur-\nrounding his death in Switzerland. In one case, an important\ncache of material in the possession of his former lawyer was\ndestroyed in a fire only six months after I had photocopied it;\n\nxiv B R O T H E R X I I\notherwise, key elements of the story would have been lost for-\never. I also travelled to New Zealand to meet with his daughter,\nour encounter being one of the highlights of my research.\nEventually, I assembled the scattered pieces of an elaborate\njigsaw puzzle, discovering in the process that the inscrutable\nfigure at the heart of the mystery was far more fascinating,\ncomplex and significant than anyone had ever realized.\nBrother XII: The Strange Odyssey of a 20th-century Prophet\nchronicles the life and exploits of Edward Arthur Wilson, an\nindividual who has largely fallen through the cracks of history.\nIn a sense, Brother XII, as Wilson called himself, was slighted\nby history, for though the lives of other occult figures have\nbeen extensively documented, his was not. He shunned the\nspotlight, seldom allowing himself to be photographed and\nresisting any cult of personality from forming around him.\nHis relative obscurity may also be attributed to the remote lo-\ncation where he established his self-sufficient community, a\nlocale that he believed would survive the coming conflagra-\ntion so graphically depicted in his apocalyptic writings. Still,\nBrother XII cast a long shadow across the occult world in\nhis time, bursting into prominence in the mid-to-late-1920s\nand becoming a controversial figure for his incendiary dia-\ntribes and his claim to be the Messenger of an ancient mystical\nBrotherhood known as the Great White Lodge. The grandiose\nnature of his mission and the bizarre and sensational events\nthat characterized his career were such that if his life were to\nbe a movie, it would be a Gone With the Wind of the occult, a\nsweeping saga featuring both the sacred and profane. Though\nother occult figures may be better known, for sheer drama,\nnothing rivals the story of Brother XII.\nWilson was a born mystic in touch with the spirit world\nfrom an early age. He was raised in a deeply religious atmo-\nsphere, delved deeply into the occult sciences, and traveled\nthe world as a mariner while in search of esoteric knowledge.\nHe had a profound understanding of metaphysics and pre-\npared himself assiduously for a spiritual Work that he believed\n\nPreface xv\nwould alter the course of history. In 1924, he experienced an\nEgyptian initiation in the south of France followed by a peri-\nod of inspirational writing, during which the teachings of the\nnew spiritual movement were transmitted to him. Adopting\nthe name Brother XII, he rapidly recruited thousands to his\ncause. Intensely charismatic, he was regarded as an Initiate by\nhis adherents and was undoubtedly a megalomaniac driven to\npursue a destiny of which few men would dare to dream.\nBrother XII possessed genuine occult power, perhaps more\nthan anyone in modern history, with the possible exception of\nRasputin. In the fall of 1928, hauled into court in Nanaimo,\nBritish Columbia, by disaffected members of his organization,\nhe unleashed a potent and withering psychic assault against\nhis adversaries, knocking out a key witness and an opposing\nattorney, even toppling innocent bystanders, collateral dam-\nage in the onslaught. The powers that he demonstrated in this\ninstance and on other occasions are the sine qua non of every\nbona fide occult leader, and though others claim to have such\nabilities or grandiloquently posture their prowess in these\nrealms, Brother XII possessed this power in spades. For this\nreason alone, he deserves to be regarded as one of the most\nimportant occult figures of the past century.\nBrother XII had a knack for extracting large sums of mon-\ney from his disciples. In 1928, after only a three-hour meeting\nin a Toronto hotel, a North Carolina socialite named Mary\nConnally wrote a cheque to him for $23,000, a sum equivalent\nto $320,000 today, while a year later, Roger Painter, the “Poul-\ntry King of Florida” handed over $90,000 when he arrived at\nBrother XII’s City of Refuge, over $1,250,000 in today’s cur-\nrency. The guru who urged his followers to renounce their\npersonal possessions eventually fled with at least $400,000,\nequivalent to over seven million dollars today. By comparison,\nBonnie and Clyde, ambushed on a dusty back road in Loui-\nsiana in 1934, died with $500 on their bullet-ridden bodies,\nwhereas Brother XII and Madame Z, outlaws of a different\norder and inclination, escaped unscathed with almost a thou-\n\nxvi B R O T H E R X I I\nsand times that amount.\nA former sea-captain, Brother XII was a pirate at heart, for\nhe raided rival groups for members and brought a swashbuck-\nling swagger to the staid world of the occult. He proclaimed\na doctrine of universal brotherhood, yet could be cruel and\nvindictive, making all those who opposed him walk the plank.\nHe was both a forerunner of the New Age and a prototypical\ncult leader, the classic rogue messiah, a Nietzschean figure\nwho sought to single-handedly reshape the world according\nto his vision and reclaim an absolute spiritual and temporal\npower that he believed he’d wielded in a previous lifetime.\nHe had a meteoric career, burning out before his ambitions\ncould be realized, leaving considerable human wreckage in\nhis wake; even so, he can be reckoned among those 20th-cen-\ntury occultists who have exerted a profound though often un-\nacknowledged influence in shaping the culture and beliefs of\nour time.\nSince the publication of the original edition of this book,\nBrother Twelve: The Incredible Story of Canada’s False Prophet, the\nnumber of Internet sites, blog entries, articles, commentaries,\nbooks and other materials devoted to various aspects of Broth-\ner XII’s life has steadily increased. In addition, his writings\nare starting to reappear in print. Foundation Letters and Teach-\nings has been republished by Teitan Press, while a collection\nof letters that Wilson wrote as a young man was published in\nthe January, 2012 edition of Theosophical History. The former\npresents Brother XII in his own words as both inspired mystic\nand implacable critic of Western civilization, while the latter\nreveal a self-doubt and vulnerability that is in striking contrast\nto the armored invincibility of Brother XII, and indicate that\nWilson indeed underwent a profound transformation at a crit-\nical juncture in his life.\nBrother XII’s career stands as a sobering reminder that\none must beware of false prophets and fraudulent spiritual\nteachers, though the eternal truths that lie at the heart of his\nteachings still resonate today. “My work will live,” he defiantly\n\nPreface xvii\ndeclared while being attacked by his enemies. His prediction\nmay well come true, though it seems more likely that the myth\nthat has grown up around him is what will endure. For all that\nis known about him, Brother XII remains an enigma, the ulti-\nmate man of mystery, an elusive figure who will never be fully\nunderstood, but who deserves his own special place in history.\nJohn Oliphant\nJanuary 5, 2016\n\n\n\n1\nForeword\nby Colin Wilson\nW\nhen John Oliphant first told me about Brother\nXII—in Seattle in 1988—I was amused and greatly\nintrigued. One of my favourite books has always\nbeen Martin Gardner’s \nFads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,\nfull of uproarious accounts of cranks who believe the earth is\nflat or hollow, or that God encoded his secrets in the Great\nPyramid. It sounded as if Brother XII deserved a distinguished\nplace in this gallery of monomaniacs and self-deceivers. Which\nis why I immediately agreed to write a foreword to this book,\nsight unseen.\nA few weeks later, when I was back in Cornwall, John sent me\na copy of Brother XII’s \nUnsigned Letters from an Elder Brother,\nreprinted in 1979 by Aura Press of Montreal. Its first page re-\ninforced my impression that Edward Wilson was a religious\nnut with an exalted sense of his own importance. He begins\nby demanding that his disciples should renounce all other\nteachers and schools while under his guidance—another way\nof demanding that they should cease to think for themselves—\nthen goes on to stake his own claim to uniqueness: “Most\nof you have learned from past experience something of this\n\n2 B R O T H E R X I I\nbusiness of seeking knowledge; you have sought much and\ngained little; have found platitudes and moralisings, the out-\nworn and the threadbare, under a slightly differing form of\nwords. The world is filled with make-believe teachers and the\nvarious cults they represent. Having sampled them, you should\nknow their worth or their worthlessness.” He then goes on to\ndescribe himself as an initiate and one of the Illuminati. . .\nYet within the next few pages, the Elder Brother began to\nhold my attention with assertions that made good sense. He\nbegins by emphasizing the importance of the will in achieving\n“true knowledge”; this immediately distinguishes him from\nthe religious cranks who ramble on about man’s hopeless\nwickedness, and the need for surrender to the will of God. He\nthen asserts that the beginning of “the work” depends on the\ntransference of the center of consciousness from “the visible\nto the invisible, from the phenomenal to the real.” Having\nsaid which, he makes it clear that he is not speaking about the\nneed to believe a dozen impossible things before breakfast,\nbut about the need to escape our restricted human viewpoint,\nand to take a broader and more scientific view, like that of\nsomeone who recognizes that, in spite of all appearances, the\nearth is not flat. He emphasizes, rightly, that this process calls\nfor courage and perseverance. And when he goes on to speak\nabout love, he shows the same oddly down-to-earth approach,\nemphasizing that it should be recognized as the fundamental\ncreative force of the universe. He even quotes Ouspensky’s\nearly masterpiece \nTertium Organum, which made such an\nimpact in the 1920s because of its scientific approach to prob-\nlems of “the mystical.”\nQuite clearly, then, this man was no imposter, no “religious\ncaterpillar,” setting out to deceive the gullible with the usual\nvaporous generalizations. He possessed some degree of real\nknowledge. Then how had he turned into the vindictive and\nhomicidal messiah that John Oliphant had described to me?\nI had to wait another year to find out. And when, at last, the\nbulky typescript arrived in the post, I was at first intimidated\n\nForeword 3\nby its sheer size—like most writers, I have only a limited time\nfor reading. (Middleton Murry once said he couldn’t afford\nto read a book unless he wrote one.) But when I finally set-\ntled down to it, I found myself totally absorbed. Long before I\nwas halfway through, I was convinced that John Oliphant has\nwritten a book that will become a classic of its kind. I know\nof no more fascinating or better researched study of a “false\nmessiah.”\nIn fact, it was all so readable and informative that I found\nmyself wondering what I could possibly say in a foreword\nthat would not spoil the reader’s pleasure by “giving away the\nplot.” And it was not until I came to the very final pages (after\na non-stop session of about six hours) that I saw the answer.\nJohn Oliphant has learned all the important facts about the\n“religious mission” of Brother XII. But he is unable to tell us\nsome of the things that we would most like to know—things\nwe could only learn if Edward Wilson had written an autobio-\ngraphical work like the journals of George Fox. James Wilkie,\nthe contemporary psychic who has the last word in the book,\ndrops a hint of the kind of thing I would love to know. “In his\nyouth, he was a restless soul. He had terrible depressions. He\nwas in contact with forces he had to obey; he knew he couldn’t\nlead a normal life. There was a time when he lived alone,\ncompletely isolated—he wanted no contact with a human\nbeing, I feel that when he was young he was more pure, more\nordained psychically and spiritually.”\nThis, of course, is why I found Wilson so fascinating—I had\nimmediately recognized him as one of those curious, anoma-\nlous figures to whom I had devoted my first book, \nThe Outsider.\n“Outsiders” are anomalous because it is so easy to jump to\nobvious conclusions about them, and dismiss them simply\nas cranks or psychotics. Nietzsche and Nijinsky went insane;\nvan Gogh had a nervous breakdown and committed suicide;\nDostoyevsky’s most distinguished contemporaries dismissed\nhim as hopelessly morbid (Tolstoy called him “the hospital\nmuse”). But George Fox, the founder of the Quakers, went to\n\n4 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe heart of the matter when he wrote: “I saw Professors and\npriests and people who were whole and at ease in that con-\ndition that was my misery, and they loved that which I would\nhave been rid of. . .” Such men are “outsiders” because they\nare tormented by an urge to “self surmounting” that most\npeople see as a kind of neurotic egoism. The young Fox de-\nscribes how “I went to another ancient priest at Mancetter in\nWarwickshire, and reasoned with him about the ground of\ndespair and temptations, but he was ignorant of my condition\nand bade me take tobacco and sing psalms. . .”\nIt seems obvious that Edward Wilson was one of the same\ntype as George Fox, and that his restless travels around the\nworld were an attempt to find something that eluded him.\nOne of the most important clues to his career as a “messiah”\nis the fact that his parents were “Irvingites.” Edward Irving\nwas a Scottish minister, born in 1792, who was appointed to\nthe Caledonian Church in Hatton Garden in 1822. He was\nconvinced that the Second Coming was imminent, and his con-\ngregation experienced violent transports of religious emotion\ncomparable to the behaviour of teenage fans at modern pop\nconcerts. In 1830, he began to offer up prayers for some mir-\nacle to attest the truth of his visions, and in the following year\nmembers of his congregation began “speaking in tongues”—\nin languages other than their own, sometimes gobbledegook,\nbut not infrequently foreign languages with which they were\nunfamiliar. The “voices” told Irving that he had been chosen\nto be a new Isaiah, and that at the end of forty days, he would\nhave the power to work miracles; but it failed to happen. In\n1833 he was dismissed, and a year later died of tuberculosis.\nNow in this, and in dozens of other such cases, the “ra-\ntionalist” explanation of hysteria and delusions of grandeur\nsimply fails to cover the facts. There can be no doubt that\nmany of Irving’s followers spoke in foreign languages they\nhad never learned. What we are now dealing with is a phe-\nnomenon known to everyone who has taken the slightest\ninterest in “Spiritualism.” To those who find it vaguely repel-\n\nForeword 5\nlent, Spiritualism sounds like a fabric of self-deception; yet\nthere can be no doubt whatever that many of its phenomena\nare genuine, and that mediums very frequently contact “the\ndead”— or at least some disembodied entities other than\nthemselves. Yet it is equally certain that a large number of\nthese “communications” are simply not to be trusted; as G. K.\nChesterton complained, “they tell lies.”\nWorse still, they can lead fairly sensible people into a\nmorass of self-aggrandizement. I can cite one example from\npersonal knowledge. A friend of mine—let us call him “L”—\nproved to be an exceptional “dowser.” Not only was he able\nto detect underground water, but he could even detect faults\nin underground electric cables—thus saving Electricity Board\nengineers a great deal of wasted effort. He often came to stay\nwith us, and spent a great deal of time with a pendulum in his\nhand, for example, testing food to find out whether it would\nbe good for him. (The pendulum may swing in a circle for\nyes, and back and forth for no.) He also found that the pen-\ndulum could “answer” all kinds of other questions, such as\nthe age of “standing stones,” of which we have many in the\nsouthwest of England. But as the years went by, he became\nincreasingly cranky. He finally died quite suddenly, and I\nlearned the truth about those final years from his friend (and\nmine) Jan de Hartog, the Dutch novelist. Jan told me that,\nthrough his pendulum, “L” had become convinced that he\nwas in touch with some great primeval goddess, and that she\nhad chosen him as her representative on earth; he would per-\nform miracles, and go down in history as the saviour of the\nhuman race. This sounds like straightforward delusions of\ngrandeur; but Jan knew better. He himself had learned to use\na pendulum at a dowsers’ conference, and begun to obtain\nincredible information, all of it objectively verifiable. But one\nnight, living alone in a cabin in a remote area, his pendulum\ntold him that he was in contact with the Earth Goddess, and\nthat she had selected him as her messenger. This went on for\nseveral days, and Jan was staggered at the information that was\n\n6 B R O T H E R X I I\npouring into his head. One night, the goddess offered to give\nhim definite proof of her reality. The next day, she said, when\nhe was out riding with a group of other people, a girl’s horse\nwould stumble near a waterfall, and she would break her leg.\nThe following day, the horses passed the waterfall without in-\ncident. That night, Jan asked the goddess, “What happened?”\nand she explained that, at the crucial moment, her mind had\nbeen distracted, so she had failed to make the horse stumble.\nJan was appalled. “Do you mean to say you were going to make\nthat girl break her leg, just to convince me?” The goddess re-\nplied that that was precisely her intention. Whereupon Jan\nannounced that he had no desire to hear from her again; a\ngoddess with such deficient notions of morality was clearly a\nliability. . . And this was more or less what had happened to\nour friend “L,” except that he had remained convinced of his\ndivine mission.\nIt has happened to many others, and caused varying de-\ngrees of havoc. In Cairo in March 1904, a student of “magick”\nnamed Aleister Crowley heard a voice speaking out of the\nair and dictating a “message for mankind.” The result was a\nstrange Swinburnian compilation called \nThe Book of the Law,\nand to the end of his life, Crowley believed it was dictated by\nAiwass, his Holy Guardian Angel. On the basis of this work,\nCrowley believed that he was the Christ of a new age, and\nthat the era of Crowleyanity would soon replace Christianity\nthroughout the world. But his “Guardian Angel” failed to live\nup to his promises; there were humiliations, defeats, scandals,\ncourt cases (which he lost), and finally a period of poverty and\nneglect, ending in his death in Hastings. Readers of this life of\nBrother XII will recognize the pattern.\nThe career of Rudolf Steiner also provides some inter-\nesting parallels. When Steiner delivered a series of lectures to\nthe Berlin Theosophical Society in 1900, he was already well\nknown as a Goethe scholar and the author of a number of\nbooks on philosophy. Like Brother XII, he admired Madame\nBlavatsky, and had already demonstrated that he possessed\n\nForeword 7\ncertain “paranormal” powers. Like Wilson, he deeply im-\npressed the Theosophists, and soon became head of the\nGerman section. His own brand of Theosophy was rooted\nin Christian mysticism. His success was tremendous, and he\nsoon became—what Wilson failed to become—a deeply influ-\nential force throughout pre-war Europe. He broke with the\nSociety when British Theosophists tried to foist a boy called\nJiddu Krishnamurti on them as the new messiah. Steiner went\non to found a “spiritual centre” in Switzerland, around an im-\npressive building called the Goetheanum, founded successful\nschools and clinics, and for a while looked set to become the\nmost influential spiritual teacher of the twentieth century. He\neven set out—like Wilson—to exert political influence. But\nhe was hated by Nazis and Communists alike, and after the\nGoetheanum was burned to the ground in 1922, he wore him-\nself out with lectures and interviews with “disciples” needing\nadvice. In 1924, exhausted and discouraged, he died of a\nstomach ailment, possibly cancer.\nSo there is, it seems, a certain risk attached to becoming a\nprophet and spiritual leader. Steiner was better able to cope\nwith it than Crowley, because he seems to have been a genu-\ninely decent and saintly man. Yet all these “avatars” seem to\nfind themselves drawn into the same web of difficulty and\ncompromise. The writer and the artist work alone, and try\nto project their vision through words or music or paint on\ncanvas. “Teachers” who try to exert a direct influence on other\npeople, to become gurus and messiahs, seem prone to “entan-\nglement,” to involvement with fools and timewasters, which\noften brings out the worst in them. Even when, like Steiner,\nthey are too decent as human beings to succumb to power-\nmania or paranoia, they seem to find themselves in a trap that\ndefies all attempts to escape.\nSo this, in a nutshell, is the tragedy of Edward Wilson. John\nOliphant’s account makes it clear that, at the beginning of his\n“mission,” he was balanced, clear-sighted, and self controlled.\nMy own guess is that he was a genuine “outsider” figure who\n\n8 B R O T H E R X I I\nhad spent his life in a tortured quest for personal evolution.\nHis stay in the village in the south of France brought some\nkind of “revelation.” (Jung has described in his \nMemories,\nDreams, Reflections how he had many “visions” like the one de-\nscribed in the first chapter.) He was obviously an intelligent\nand widely-read man, and I suspect that his dire prophecies of\nthe end of civilization may have been inspired by Spengler’s\nbest-selling \nThe Decline of the West. The story of how, in the face\nof all obstacles, he founded the colony on Vancouver Island\nforms one of the most remarkable chapters in this book.\nWhat then went wrong? Was Wilson, like Crowley and so\nmany other messiahs, something of a sex maniac? The evi-\ndence points in that direction. Yet I think the true answer is\nthat, like my friend “L,” he lacked the psychological stability\nto remain balanced and normal while leading the highly ab-\nnormal life of a “spiritual leader” and guru. Some readers may\nprefer Wilkie’s explanation that “he worked with angels—\nspirits of all kinds—sometimes of a lower order. He drew\nradical earthbound souls to him.” The strange episodes of\n“black magic” in the courtroom seem to support this view. But\nin the last analysis, the reader must make his own judgement.\nWhat is so fascinating about this book is that the author has\nprovided all the necessary materials in abundance.\n\n9\nCHAPTER\nI\nMessenger of the Masters\nO\nn a crisp autumn day in 1924, a forty-six-year-old\nretired English sea-captain named Edward Arthur\nWilson arrived in a small village in the south of\nFrance. A slender man with delicate features, iron-grey hair,\nand a neatly trimmed Van Dyke beard, he had little money\nand was in poor health. He rented a room in a small \npension\nand unpacked his bags. He planned to spend the winter in the\nvillage living as quietly and cheaply as possible.\nWilson’s travels as a mariner had taken him to nearly\nevery country in the world, allowing him to mix with people\nof all nationalities at every level of society. According to his\nown account, these outward travels corresponded to an inner\njourney—a long and arduous search for knowledge. During\nhis pilgrimage, Wilson visited temples, shrines, and sacred\nsites in many countries, including Egypt, India, China, and\nMexico. He studied the religions of the world, investigated\nnumerous occult doctrines, and immersed himself in the\n\n10 B R O T H E R X I I\nteachings of Theosophy. He also practised various spiritual\ndisciplines by which he achieved higher states of conscious-\nness. Throughout these difficult, often lonely years, Wilson\nsustained himself by his belief that he had a mission to serve\nmankind, and that his studies and travels were preparing him\nfor a unique spiritual destiny.\nIn October, shortly after arriving in the village, Wilson had\na number of remarkable experiences which signalled the be-\nginning of his career as a spiritual leader. He described these\nexperiences in a letter, which was later published in his book\nFoundation Letters and Teachings:\nOctober 19, 1924, I was not feeling well, and had gone to\nbed early. At this time, I wanted to get some milk to drink,\nso I lit the candle which stood on a small table at the side\nof my bed. Immediately after lighting it, I saw the Tau sus-\npended in mid-air just beyond the end of my bed, and at a\nheight of eight or nine feet. I thought, “That is strange; it\nmust be some curious impression upon the retina of the\neye which I got by lighting the candle. I will close my eyes\nand it will then stand out more clearly.”\nI shut my eyes at once, and \nthere was nothing there. I opened\nthem and saw the Tau in the same place, but much more\ndistinctly; it was like soft golden fire, and it glowed with a\nbeautiful radiance. This time, in addition to the Tau, there\nwas a five-pointed Star very slightly below it, and a little to\nthe right. Again I closed my eyes and there was nothing\non the retina. Again I opened them and the vision was still\nthere, but now it seemed to radiate fire. I watched it for\nsome time, then it gradually dimmed and faded slowly from\nmy sight.\nThe next day, Wilson recorded his interpretation of the\nvision: the Tau cross, more commonly known as the \nankh, or\nEgyptian ansate cross, confirmed to him that his path to ini-\ntiation was Egyptian. It also signified that the Mysteries of that\n\nMessenger of the Masters 11\nancient spiritual tradition were about to be restored to the\nmodern world. The five-pointed star symbolized adeptship,\nthat state of profound knowledge and insight towards which\nhe’d been striving.\nThe next day, Wilson was walking in meditation, when he\nheard certain words repeated in his mind with startling force\nand insistence. He realized that these “passwords” were re-\nlated to his vision of the night before, and he immediately\nreturned to his room to write them down.\nOn October 22, Wilson had again gone to bed early, as he\nwas not feeling well:\nLying in the darkness and thinking of nothing in partic-\nular, I was suddenly aware of a most extraordinary stillness.\nMy window was wide open, but all the usual night noises\nwere silenced; there was not a rustle of a leaf, nor any\nmovement of the air. Then I became aware, in some inte-\nrior manner, that I was to hear a Voice, so I lay still and\nlistened. Immediately, I had the sensation of looking down\nan immense vista of Time, a roofless corridor flanked with\nthousands and thousands of pillars. I seemed to be looking\ninto both Time and Space at once.\nThen, from an immeasurable distance, came the Voice,\nfaint but very clear and wonderfully sweet; it conveyed a\nsense of unutterable majesty and power. The bed shook, the\nroom wherein I lay was shaken, and the very air throbbed\nand vibrated. I listened to the Voice, filled with a sense of its\nimmense and awful distance. It said—\n“THOU WHO HAST WORN THE DOUBLE CROWN OF\nUPPER AND LOWER EGYPT, OF THE HIGH KNOWL-\nEDGE AND THE LOW, HUMBLE THYSELF, PREPARE\nTHY HEART, FOR THE MIGHTY ONES HAVE NEED\nOF THEE. THOU SHALT REBUILD, THOU SHALT\nRESTORE. THEREFORE, PREPARE THY MIND FOR\nTHAT WHICH SHALL ILLUMINE THEE.”\n\n12 B R O T H E R X I I\nA cold wind blew down that enormous aisle of pillars;\nsomewhere in the endless distance, lights seemed to move;\nthen from above my head, the light flooded me so that\nthe distance and the vistas were dissolved. Then the light\nfaded and I lay still, filled with a sense of wonder and a great\nreverence.\nWilson realized that the Voice belonged to one of the\nDhyanis, a group of powerful Egyptian dieties. “I knew that\nthe time was near,” he wrote.\nThe following year, Wilson had resumed his travels. In the\nlounges of ocean liners, in railway carriages, and in cheap\nboarding houses, he wrote feverishly as the vision of his des-\ntiny burned before him.\nIn September, 1925, he arrived in Genoa, Italy. In the\neleven months since his visions in the south of France, he’d\nexperienced a marked widening of his normal consciousness.\nAutomatic writing, which he had practised only intermittently\nbefore, had now become a faculty he could activate at will. He\nbegan to go into a trance regularly in order to receive a book\nof spiritual teachings.\nThe book was dictated to him by a “Master of Wisdom,”\none of those highly evolved spiritual Beings who, according to\nTheosophical teaching, form an occult Brotherhood known\nas the Great White Lodge, said to guide the destiny of the\nhuman race.\nDaily, throughout the fall and winter, Wilson received the\npages of the manuscript, often in an out-of-body state. “During\nthe writing of some parts of it,” he later explained, “I was taken\nin the subtle body to a certain place, and there given some of\nthe sentences word by word by the Master as in quiet conver-\nsation between two individuals—the whole of Part Three was\ngiven in that way.”\nWilson finished the manuscript on February 13, 1926, and\nimmediately wrote to one of his associates (the identity of\nhis correspondents during this period has never been deter-\n\nMessenger of the Masters 13\nmined), telling him about the book:\n“Three or four months ago, I commenced writing something\nquite out of the ordinary, a statement of the fundamental phi-\nlosophy of life. When I commenced it, I did not at all realize\nits deep significance, though I was kept continually amazed at\nthe wonderful beauty and the deep truths that were given to\nme. Every line is written from the higher mental plane. For\nhours at a time and for days in succession, I was rapt right out\nof the body—the mere writing of it is something I shall never\nforget. It is to be called \nThe Three Truths.”\nThe Three Truths was a commentary upon three truths basic\nto Theosophical teaching: namely, the unity of all life; the im-\nmortality of the soul; and the law of karma. Wilson stated that\nthe failure of the human race to recognize these truths and to\nincorporate them into its scheme of life was responsible for\nthe appalling conditions of the modern world:\n“The ‘civilized’ nations of the world are now entering upon\nan era of destruction and chaos, but it is to be followed none\nthe less surely by an era of reconstruction and progress. These\nthree truths are, in themselves, that spiritual basis upon which\nthe new order shall be built.”\nThe Master who had dictated \nThe Three Truths now revealed\nto Wilson that he’d chosen him to be his personal chela or\ndisciple. Since the Master was the twelfth “Brother” in the\nGreat White Lodge, he gave Wilson, as his disciple, the name\n“Brother XII.” This relationship between Master and disciple\nwas poetically expressed in the foreword to The Three Truths:\nTHE WORD OF THE MESSENGER\nAs Mercury dwelleth near the Sun, so I abide in the\nheart of my Lord. My feet run upon His errands, and by my\nmouth are His words spoken. Many are my journeys; I have\nsojourned in far countries and have crossed wide rivers.\nMany houses have I built and afterwards demolished, and\nnow I have builded me yet another house in your midst, O\n\n14 B R O T H E R X I I\nye sons of men.\nI speak the words of Him Who hath sent me forth; He is\nthe Guide, the Instructor, the Keeper of the Mysteries. His\nwords are sure and fail not. He is the Lighter of Lamps in\nthe Temple of the Most High. Ye are the Temples, and the\nlamp is the light of Truth within you. . .\nI am the Messenger of the Fire, the Messenger of the\nWhirlwind, the Messenger of the Day of Adjustment. By the\nWind ye shall mount to the heavens—if ye be the children\nof discernment. . . But as for the stubborn, and the deaf,\nand the blind; the Wind of Destruction shall carry them\naway.\nFor the next several weeks, Wilson remained in continuous\ncontact with his Master. He learned that he’d been chosen to\ncarry forward the work of that earlier Messenger of the Great\nWhite Lodge, Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a remark-\nable Russian mystic and seer who’d founded the Theosophical\nSociety in 1875, and whose works Isis Unveiled and The Secret\nDoctrine \nare regarded as occult classics. The Society was now\nin crisis: it had split into warring factions and its leaders were\nthought by many to have betrayed the ideals of its founders.\nWilson’s Master explained that the same Masters who had in-\nspired Madame Blavatsky to found the Theosophical Society\nnow wished to do a further Work in the world, and had chosen\nhim to be their agent. His role in their multifaceted plan was\nto revive the original teachings so that Universal Brotherhood\nwould become a living spiritual reality in the world.\nOn March 6, 1926, Wilson emerged from isolation to write:\n“At last I permit myself the luxury of a personal letter; I can\nrelax. For twenty days, I have simply been the mouthpiece\nof the Master, and have rigorously excluded every personal\nthought or expression. Even as I write these words, you cannot\nyet know anything of the great Work which has been com-\nmitted to us, save it be by intuition. You can as yet know\nnothing of the far-reaching plans for the future, and the won-\nderful rapidity with which they have developed. . .”\n\nMessenger of the Masters 15\nFor the next three months, Wilson continued to receive de-\ntailed information about this new spiritual work. It would be\norganized around a group of “Brothers” who would serve as\nthe nucleus for attracting like-minded people to the cause.\nThe constitution of this inner group was of vital importance:\n“Those who compose it will form collectively the Chalice\ninto which the life of the Master will be poured. The Water of\nLife will take its colour from the vessel which contains it. That\nvessel must be clean, utterly free from the stain of selfishness\nor of ambition. Its purity must be most jealously guarded.”\nThe Work would mark the advent of a new Age in the his-\ntory of mankind:\nIn the great cycle of precession, the Pisces Age has\nended, the sign of water and blood has set, and AQUARIUS\nRISES—the mighty triangle of Air is once more in the as-\ncendant. In January of 1928, our work commences on the\nphysical plane—the special work of restoration. Jupiter, lord\nof the great religions of the world, passes \nout of Pisces and\ncomes to the conjunction of Uranus in the sign of Aries.\nThat which seems immovable shall be destroyed, so that no\nvestige of it shall remain. The Star of Jehovah, the god of\nIsrael and Christendom sets—and it sets in a sea of blood.\nRejoice my Brothers, for the Great Gods, the Mighty Ones,\nshall be made manifest before the eyes of all men.\nWilson was aware that people might be skeptical of his\nclaims, but this didn’t concern him:\n“The world will say, ‘This man is mad,’ but it has always\nsaid so of all who departed from its miserable conventionali-\nties. Moses, Gideon, the Baptist—all were mad. Jesus was\nmad; of Him they said, ‘He hath a devil.’ Savonarola, Galileo,\nH. P. Blavatsky—all were mad in the opinion of the mediocre;\nmad or inspired. I also am mad— or inspired—but I am not\nmediocre. That within me has overcome sickness, and bonds,\nand a weak body. Make no mistake, Brothers, I am not a person\n\n16 B R O T H E R X I I\nfilled with power, but a Power using a personality.”\nAnd again: “The hour has struck for this Earth to be plowed\nand harrowed. I have been called to drive the plow, to break\nthe crust and to harrow the surface. You must choose whether\nyou will be the plowshare or the clod which is broken, for the\nground must be prepared that the seed may be sown.”\nWilson saw himself as “a voice crying in the wilderness.” He\ndidn’t care if others echoed him or cried him down, so long\nas he could give his message:\n“While none amongst us may claim the title of leader, yet in\ntime of crisis, one must spring to the front and thrust his body\ninto the breach. Let that sacrifice be mine. . . I will declare\nthe Truth, and will carry out exactly and precisely the Master’s\nword. Neither now nor at any time, will I swerve a hair’s-\nbreadth from the course laid down. What He commands, that\nwill I do.”\nDuring this period, Wilson received what would become the\nmanifesto of the new spiritual movement. It was a 4,000 word\n“blueprint” of the Work, and was simply titled \nA Message from\nthe Masters of the Wisdom in 1926. His Master assured him that\nthe response to it would be overwhelming and that it would\n“sweep across the world like a prairie fire.”\nThe intensive work, however, was taxing Wilson’s already\nfrail health. In one of his letters, he explained that he had to\n“live almost constantly in the pure and immensely powerful vi-\nbrations of His [the Master’s] immediate aura. This is a great\nstrain upon the lower vehicles, for they have to be attuned to\nthose vibrations, and the result is that outwardly it makes me\nhyper-sensitive.”\nAlthough Wilson was in bed every other day with heart\ntrouble, his Master told him he must leave Genoa and go to\nEngland to organize the Work there. He had qualms about\nthe mission, since he would only have about five pounds left\nafter paying his train fare. He also had few contacts in Eng-\nland who he felt would be sympathetic to the cause. On the\neve of his departure, he wrote a final letter:\n\nMessenger of the Masters 17\n“Now I am to go to England almost at once. Beyond that,\nall is unknown. I have been told that I shall find those whom\nthe Master has chosen; they will be brought to me when the\ntime comes. I hope that it may be soon for the actual work of\norganizing is not in my line. I have little worldly wisdom or\nbusiness ability. In the meantime, I live from day to day and\ncross no bridges until I come to them. I have Master’s word for\nit that I shall find such help as I need, and that is sufficient.”\nOn May 20, Wilson packed his few belongings into two suit-\ncases, and boarded the train for England.\nr r r\nWho was this itinerant mariner and mystic who would\nbecome the leader of one of the most remarkable religious\ncolonies in North America?\nEdward Arthur Wilson was born on July 25, 1878, in\nBirmingham, England, the son of Thomas Wilson and Sarah\nEllen Pearsall. His father was a master craftsman in the city’s\nthriving metallic and brass bedstead trade, and eventually\nformed his own company, becoming a prosperous manufac-\nturer. The family lived in the district of Ladywood, then moved\nto Edgbaston, where Thomas and Sarah raised their son and\ntwo daughters in an atmosphere of strict religious devotion.\nWilson’s parents were “Irvingites,” and their membership\nin the Catholic Apostolic Church was undoubtedly the most\nimportant influence in Wilson’s development. This peculiar\nreligious sect was founded in 1830 by a charismatic Scottish\nminister named Edward Irving. Thomas Wilson was a deacon\nin the Church—there was a small but fervent congregation\nin Birmingham—and the life of the family revolved entirely\naround religion. There were daily prayers in the home—\nmorning and evening—and on Sundays the family worshipped\nin the brick and terracotta church in Summer Hill Road. The\necstatic outbursts and speaking in tongues that punctuated\nthe services were believed to be direct outpourings of the\n\n18 B R O T H E R X I I\nHoly Spirit. The Church’s central teaching was the Second\nAdvent, which was expected to occur within the lifetimes of\nthe twelve “Apostles” around whom the Church was orga-\nnized. Members prayed daily for this miracle: the dead would\nrise from their graves, and the faithful —“those with the seal\nof the living God on their foreheads”— would be caught up to\nmeet the Lord in the air. Church members studied the Book\nof Revelation in minute detail, had an intricate interpretation\nof the chief numerical symbols in the Bible, and believed that\nArchangels, Seraphim, and Cherubim were living spiritual\nBeings. “Irvingites” were often persecuted for their strange\nbeliefs.\nIn \nFoundation Letters and Teachings, Wilson writes: “From\nearly childhood, I have been in touch with super-physical\nthings, and have often received visitations from highly devel-\noped Beings, and these always brought me help or comfort or\ninstruction. At first, I thought that these were ‘Angels,’ but as\nI grew older and received teaching, I learned of the Masters\nand Their work for humanity. This direct contact continued\nall through my life from time to time, but it was not until much\nlater that I learned the reason for these experiences and the\nteaching that was given me.”\nThe other great influence in Wilson’s life was the sea. When\nhe was a boy, his father apprenticed him on a Royal Navy wind-\njammer training ship, where he acquired the skills by which\nhe would earn his living for most of his life. On his early voy-\nages, he had many adventures; he purportedly worked for a\ntime on “blackbirders,” transporting kidnapped Africans to\nTurkey, where they were sold as slaves.\nIn 1902, at the age of twenty-four, Wilson arrived in New\nZealand. There he met Margery Clark, the daughter of an\nAustralian grazier. The couple was married on Christmas\nEve in Wellington, at the Catholic Apostolic Church in Webb\nStreet. They soon had two children, a son and a daughter.\nWilson supported the young family by working as a draftsman,\nsurveyor, electrician, and farmer. Becoming restless, he up-\n\nMessenger of the Masters 19\nrooted the family and moved to Canada.\nIn 1907, Wilson arrived in British Columbia, where he\nworked as a baggage clerk for the Dominion Express Com-\npany. He was promoted several times, but quit to work as a\npilot on lumber schooners and coastal steamers plying the\nwaters between San Francisco and Alaska. He was away from\nhome a great deal.\n“I remember that I was in the hospital in Victoria for sev-\neral months with diphtheria, and he only visited me once,” his\ndaughter Margery Bell recalls. “He brought me strawberries.\nSince then, whenever I have strawberries, I think of him.”\nThe memory is a poignant one, since it was one of the last\ntimes the eight-year-old girl saw her father. Soon afterwards,\nsometime in 1912, Wilson deserted his wife and children and\nsigned on board a ship bound for the Orient. His destitute\nwife, with the assistance of relatives, returned with the chil-\ndren to New Zealand.\nWilson makes few references to his past. In \nFoundation\nLetters and Teachings, he writes that in 1912 he passed through\na “Ceremony of Dedication”:\n“It was then I understood that I had a work to do, but I did\nnot know anything of its nature or when it was to be. This was\nfollowed by twelve chaotic years of testing and wandering in\nall parts of the world. Outwardly, I was unsuccessful in every-\nthing I did, but the inner work of preparation must have been\ngoing quietly on.”\nWilson also refers to these years of wandering in \nThe Three\nTruths: “Thou wast stripped and despised of kindred./Long\nyears didst thou follow the Quest,/Ever seeking. . .”\nVery little is known about the period between the “Cere-\nmony of Dedication” in 1912 and Wilson’s visions in the south\nof France in 1924, except that he travelled widely. He sailed\naround Cape Horn, up and down the coasts of Africa and\nSouth America, and throughout the islands of the Pacific. He\nserved as a navigator during World War I, taking supplies from\nNorfolk, Virginia, across the Atlantic to England. At about the\n\n20 B R O T H E R X I I\nsame time as he received his captain’s papers, he joined the\nAmerican section of the Theosophical Society. Membership\nrecords identify him as a resident of California, living in San\nDiego, Ocean Beach, and San Francisco, care of Maxwell &\nCompany, Papeete, Tahiti. While in the South Seas, Wilson\nfell seriously ill, but was nursed back to health by a Scottish\nwoman named Elma, who became his constant companion.\nHe also spent time in an Italian monastery, became a brilliant\nastrologer, and contributed numerous articles to scholarly\nmagazines. He is said to have known the South African\nstatesman Jan Smuts, as well as such illustrious British figures\nas Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Arthur Eddington, Sir Herbert Austin,\nSir Neville Chamberlain, and the secret service agent Captain\nH. L. Stringer.\n“He was one of the most fascinating personalities and con-\nversationalists I ever met,” Victoria businessman Walter Miles\nrecalls. “His knowledge of world religions was stupendous. He\ncorresponded with spiritual and political leaders all over the\nworld. He knew all kinds of prominent people.”\nWilson undoubtedly believed that the experiences of these\nyears had inexorably led him to the most important stage of\nhis life’s work. In Genoa, he had received the \nimprimatur of\nthe Masters. He was now the chosen instrument of the Great\nWhite Lodge, consecrated and sent forth to carry out its work\nfor humanity.\nr r r\nWilson arrived in England the third week of May 1926,\nshortly after the end of the General Strike, which had paralyzed\nthe country for nine days. London was alive again with activity.\nIn Piccadilly Circus, the traffic roared around the statue of\nEros, newsboys called out the latest government scandal, and\ncinema-goers queued up to see Gloria Swanson’s newest pic-\nture at the Plaza. Wilson made his way through the crowds to\nPaternoster Square, near the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, to\n\nMessenger of the Masters 21\nthe address of The Occult Review.\nIn the offices of the world’s leading occult periodical, Wilson\nlearned from the editor, Harry J. Strutton, that far from being\nunknown in England, he was already being hailed as a gifted\npsychic and major prophet. Strutton informed him that an ar-\nticle Wilson had written in Genoa and mailed to the magazine\nhad been printed in the May issue and caused a sensation.\nLetters had poured in from all over the world, and the article\nhad become the focus for a heated debate over the value of\nprophecy.\n“The Shadow,” which appeared under the pseudonym “E.\nA. Chaylor” (Was the name “Chaylor” perhaps an allusion to\n“chela” ?) took for its theme the adage “Whom the gods would\ndestroy, they first make mad.” The article was based upon in-\nformation his Master had given him while staying in Genoa.\nAs he wrote at the time:\nWhile it is true that we are still in the Kali Yuga [“The\nBlack Age”], yet the cycle which will commence about 1975\nwill be more favourable on the whole. In it, the balance of\npower will be on the side of righteousness and progress.\nBut between that time and the present, there stretches a\nveritable gulf of horror through which poor humanity must\nstruggle as best as it can. The forces of Evil, knowing that\ntheir time is short, are making a supreme effort to engulf\nas many as possible. Soon they are to be “bound for a thou-\nsand years.” That expression is scriptural and allegorical,\nbut it well describes the conditions that will prevail.\nMy Brothers, before they are bound, they shall be loosed.\nThe flood of evil which is even now so unmistakably rising\nwill be manifested on three planes. Physically, it will take the\nshape of national wars, anarchy, bloodshed, and Bolshevism.\nAll restraints being removed, the passions of men will be\nloosed; private murder will be a common-place and go un-\navenged; every kind of foul excess will flourish unchecked.\nOn the mental plane, the thoughts and inventions of men\n\n22 B R O T H E R X I I\nwill be placed at the service of demons, and will be used for\nthe wholesale destruction of humanity. Those who perish\nwill be more fortunate than those who remain.\nPsychically, the prospect is more terrible even than this.\nThere will shortly come about what I can only describe as\nthe breaking of a dam. All the evil forces and powers of the\nlower astral worlds will burst the barriers which have hith-\nerto restrained them. They will shortly flood this physical\nworld in such a tidal-wave of horror as no living generation\nhas seen. To find its parallel, one must go back to the closing\nperiods of the great Atlantean epoch. . .\nIn “The Shadow,” Wilson gave the reasons why this disaster\nwas inevitable. He explained that the unceasing warfare on\ninner planes between the forces of Evil and the forces of Light\nhad now reached a crisis. The situation had been made worse\nby the efforts of misguided Spiritualists trying to contact de-\nceased relatives: by weakening the barrier which separated the\ntwo worlds, they made it easier for evil astral entities to invade\nthe physical plane, thus helping to precipitate the horror which\nwas soon to overwhelm mankind. Wilson’s article concluded\nwith a prophetic vision that he claimed to have received in full\nwaking consciousness:\nI saw the land (Europe) spread out below me. At the four\ncorners stood four Men, holding each the corner of a black\ncloth. Now a wind came from the East, causing the cloth to\nbillow and shake. Then I asked one of the Men, “What is\nthe meaning of the cloth?” And he said, “\nIt is the Shadow of\nthose things about to come upon the Earth.” Then the four Men\nlowered the cloth, and it covered all the land.\nThe wind now blew with violence, and there was a great\nshaking, with clamour and confusion, and the cloth became\nsoaked with blood. Then I asked the Man, “Why are these\nthings done?” And he answered me, “\nBecause those things\nwhich hinder are about to be removed\n.” And I said, “What are\n\nMessenger of the Masters 23\nthe things which are to be removed?” And again he an-\nswered me, “They are three: the first two shall be destroyed by\nthe third, and the third, when its work is accomplished, shall be\nchanged\n.”\nYet again, I asked him, “How soon shall these things be?”\nAnd he said, “\nThe lands which you see have passed the Cycle of\nHate; they are now in the Cycle of Madness. The next Cycle is the\nCycle of Destruction\n.” And I said, “How long until this Cycle\nshall end?” And he answered me, “In about two years it shall\nend, and destruction shall commence. Then, in nine years, the\ntimes of nine nations shall be accomplished\n.”\nNow the cloth dissolved away, and the land was seen to be\ndesolate. The lines which had divided it were removed, and\nover all there was silence. Then, out of the silence, was heard\na Trumpet, and a Voice speaking Wisdom. And because of\nthe silence, the people heard the Voice, and thereafter, for\na space, there was Peace in the land.\nHarry J. Strutton, editor of \nThe Occult Review, was deeply\naffected by the prophecy in “The Shadow.” His several meet-\nings with Wilson confirmed his belief that he was “a gifted\nnatural seer.” Wilson told Strutton that the “way of escape” re-\nferred to in the article was the Work of the Masters described\nin A Message from the Masters of the Wisdom. He gave Strutton\na typescript copy to read, and explained that although most\npeople would perish, a few individuals would be saved from\nthe horrors that were about to overwhelm European civiliza-\ntion. These few would be spared by virtue of the saving grace\nwithin them: they would be the ones to carry forward this new\nWork of the Masters. Strutton was impressed by \nThe Message.\nHe immediately telephoned a small firm of printers, Edward\nand Charles Straker Limited, and arranged for them to print\nit for the very reasonable sum of twelve pounds. Grateful for\nStrutton’s assistance, Wilson thanked him and left the office.\nHe did not tell the editor that although the cost of printing\nThe Message was modest, he’d arrived in London with only a\n\n24 B R O T H E R X I I\nfew pounds to his name. Fortunately, events again conspired\non his behalf:\n“About this time, I received an offer of four pounds to help\nwith the cost; this was from a poor man, dependent upon a\nsalary, and he gave all he had. To this, I added four pounds\nfrom what was left over from my travelling expenses and in-\ncidentals. It was not enough, and I did not know what to do.\nThen, he who had given the four pounds received an unex-\npected present of money just at that time—this also was four\npounds; he gave it at once and \nThe Message was put in the\npress.”\nA Message from the Masters of the Wisdom announced the\nfact that the Masters were about to do a further Work in the\nworld, that their plans were complete, and that the Work had\ncommenced upon the physical plane. The basic teaching of\nThe Message was Universal Brotherhood, but delivered in the\ncontext of a world crisis—the imminent destruction of the\npresent social and political order—it possessed a compelling\nforce and urgency:\n“In the near future, existing institutions will be overturned,\nand practically all religious and philosophical teaching will be\nblotted out. Therefore, the Masters, foreseeing these things\nwhich are soon to come upon the Earth, have prepared the\npresent Work. It is an Ark of Refuge wherein will be preserved\nall that is true in existing teachings, and into which a new mea-\nsure of Knowledge and Power will be poured.”\nThe immediate purpose of the Work was to provide indi-\nviduals with the training and encouragement necessary for\nthem to achieve spiritual enlightenment. The second part of\nthe Work was the training of succeeding generations:\nThe children who by their karma will be drawn to par-\nents who are linked up with this present Work belong to a\ngroup of highly evolved egos [souls] who are now begin-\nning to come into incarnation. They must be kept free from\n\nMessenger of the Masters 25\nkarmic ties or links connecting them with the old and dying\norder. They will be the Thinkers and the Leaders in that\nnew order which shall arise from the ashes of the old. . .\nThere will be a constant influx of these egos from the\npresent time until approximately 1975. Those who are now\nchildren, or who are born within the next few years, will be\nthe parents of that army which will be in its very early prime\nin 1975. It is these, the grandchildren of our present day,\nwho will have the chief part in the great Work that ushers\nin the year Two thousand. The work we have to accomplish\nis spiritual and hidden; that of 1975 will be manifest and\nlargely concerned with the affairs of the outer world. Our\npresent task is to prepare those who will be the Rulers and\nGovernors of that period, which will be an era of righteous\ngovernment, when the people of the Earth will be justly\nruled. We have to train these children in just Principles and\nin true Ideals.\nThe Message explained that the Work was one of prepara-\ntion for the founding of a more evolved race of humanity:\nThe leading nations of Europe, together with their off-\nshoots and colonies, form collectively a distinct group or\nclass with its special characteristics and destiny; these are\nknown to students of world history as the fifth sub-race.\nAlready these have reached their apex (as respects the\nparent or European nations), and have entered a period\nof rapid decline. This decline is rooted in moral and spiri-\ntual degeneracy. Knowledge and inventive genius is placed\nat the disposition of governments for purposes of mutual\ndestruction; science is already invading forbidden ground\nand penetrating secrets which are the heritage of the suc-\nceeding (sixth) race. A halt must therefore be called, and\nthe necessary re-adjustments made.\nThose souls linked with the new race, \nThe Message ex-\n\n26 B R O T H E R X I I\nplained, were incarnating in increasing numbers. Many of\nthese were adepts who would bring with them vast stores of\nknowledge supposed to have been lost with the earlier races\nof humanity:\n“These, the more advanced egos, will respond to the\npresent call: they will be coordinated and linked together by\nmeans of this Work, and finally, under the direct guidance\nof the Masters Themselves, will form on the physical plane\nthe nucleus of the coming sixth sub-race. The plans of the\nMasters involve the formation of Centers of Safety where, at\na later stage, actual colonies will be founded and the coming\ntype evolved. There will be more than one Center, but in each\ncase, they will be in places secure from outside interference\nof any kind, and safe from surrounding chaos and disaster.”\nThe Message also stated that the Work was a form of prepa-\nration for “HIM WHO IS TO COME,” an Avatar or divine\nBeing who would appear on Earth in the closing years of the\ncentury to found and stabilize the sixth sub-race.\nThe Work announced by \nThe Message was directly con-\ncerned with the coming Age of Aquarius, a period that would\nlast for approximately two thousand years: “The Message given\nis the first Trumpet-blast of the New Age, and the Standard\nwe set up is the Standard of the new Order.” The Message itself\nwould act as a touchstone: those persons who had an affinity\nwith the Work would be drawn to it by a process of “spiritual\nself-selection.” \nThe Message concluded:\nThis is the Message of the Masters, the Message of\nBrotherhood. It is simple and easy to understand; the issue\nis perfectly clear. By every man to whom this Message comes,\nit must be either accepted or rejected. No neutral position\nis possible, for this Message shall divide the Wheat from the\nChaff; it is a sword that shall pierce to the heart of every ear-\nnest man—the sword of Truth.\n\nMessenger of the Masters 27\nThe declaration of the truth of Universal Brotherhood is the\nMessenger’s guarantee and surest credential from the Masters\nWhom he represents. This and no other.\nTHE MESSAGE IS EVERYTHING, THE PERSONALITY\nOF THE MESSENGER IS NOTHING. ON THE\nACCEPTANCE OF THE MESSAGE ITSELF, ALL MUST\nSTAND OR FALL.\nPeace be to all Beings.\nr\nAfter publishing The Message, Wilson visited his parents in\nBournemouth, staying at their home at 4 Queens Park South.\nThomas Wilson had retired, a wealthy man, to the south of\nEngland. In the lovely garden behind “Ontario,” Wilson was\nable to relax and to reply to his growing volume of corre-\nspondence. In a letter dated July 17, 1926, he explained that\nhe’d published “The Shadow” under the pseudonym “E. A.\nChaylor” because “it is necessary that I personally remain un-\nrecognized and unknown—it is an essential working condition,\notherwise I should be pestered with phenomena hunters.”\nIn the August issue of The Occult Review, Wilson published a\nsequel to “The Shadow,” also under the name Chaylor. This\ntoo created a tremendous stir.\nIn relentlessly grim language, “The Tocsin” painted the pic-\nture of Europe poised upon the brink of destruction. Wilson\nused the image of a bell tolling to vivid effect:\nFor centuries, it has rung out the triumphs of Might and\nsounded the dictates of Intolerance. It has heralded con-\nquering armies and rung the Assembly for execution, the\nfire, and the stake. It has been the last sound to beat upon\nthe ears of the dying, it has drowned the anguished cries of\ncountless millions.\n\n28 B R O T H E R X I I\nThis Bell was shaped by human hands, fashioned in the\nhearts and minds of men. It was melted and moulded by\nfierce passions, and beaten by the hammers of selfishness\nupon the anvils of hardened hearts. Men made it, and men\ntoll it.\nToday, it sounds for Consummation, for the dissolution of\nthe Old Order and for the uprising of the New. The chemist,\nbrewing wholesale death in new and horrible forms, pauses\nin his work to listen to it. The feet of millions, armed and\ndrilled for murder, keep time to its tolling. The politician,\nthe publisher, the preacher—all hear it, but none give it\nheed. Only the people do not hear, or if they hear, they fail\nto understand; they are busied with their own concerns—\naffairs of the market, or of marriage, or of sport.\nThe article’s ruthless criticism of modern civilization prom-\npted a flood of letters to \nThe Occult Review. Some readers\naccused Wilson/Chaylor of scare-mongering: “Mr. Chaylor\nloves to make our flesh creep, but does he really and honestly\nbelieve that ‘in Europe today, all are morally and spiritu-\nally decadent’?” Numerous others wrote in to support him\nwith astrology, numerology (“1928 reduces to 2, a number\nof selfishness, contention, and enmity”), Biblical scripture,\nPyramidology, and their own premonitions of impending\ndoom. One correspondent even suggested that “The Shadow”\nand “The Tocsin” be published together in a pamphlet and\ndistributed countrywide: “There is as yet no spiritual Moscow\nto finance such a propaganda, but surely the financial diffi-\nculty should not be so great, seeing that even A Message from\nthe Masters of Wisdom is offered to a troubled and discordant\nworld for threepence!”\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes\nand a champion of Spiritualism, entered the fray. He wrote to\nthe editor of \nThe Occult Review, accusing Wilson of attacking\nSpiritualism: “Your contributor speaks as if Spiritualism itself,\nby thinning the walls which divide us from the unseen, may\n\nMessenger of the Masters 29\nadmit a flood of evil. Such a supposition would presuppose\nthat in the Borderland, there was more evil than good, which\ncannot be said of God’s realm. On the contrary, such a thin-\nning of the barrier would give wider entrance to all the angelic\nforces which may save and redeem the world.”\nWilson replied to Conan Doyle: “In the ‘Borderland’ of\nthe Spiritualist, there \nis more evil than good, for while it is\n‘God’s realm,’ in the sense that all realms are subject to divine\noversight, it is also a realm inimical to humanity, and man\nincurs great evil and danger by forcing an entrance thereto.\nExperimental, and therefore uninstructed tampering with the\nforces and powers of the astral world will result in widespread\nevil and disaster. I do not say that it may, but that it certainly\nwill; it is not a supposition, but an unqualified statement based\nupon exact knowledge.”\nHe concluded his letter by saying: “‘The proof of the pud-\nding is in the eating,’ and I think that the issue will be decided\nbeyond any possibility of dispute between this present time of\nwriting and the close of 1928.”\nWilson was less concerned now with answering his critics\nthan he was with replying to those individuals who’d re-\nsponded to \nThe Message. It had been advertised in The Occult\nReview, and many people had written to him, wanting to know\nmore about the Work.\nHe replied to these queries with a mimeographed letter\nwhich stated that the Masters were accepting as disciples\nthose individuals who were prepared to serve unselfishly in\nthe Cause. The letter claimed that the Work was the inaugu-\nration of a new era of righteousness and truth: it embodied\nthe ideals of the New Age and worked for their practical re-\nalization. For the first time, the name of the new spiritual\nmovement was given:\n“We are called to serve as the Pioneers of a new Race\nand a new Ideal, and pioneering calls for vision, for\ncourage, and for the strength of self-sacrifice. We are\n\n30 B R O T H E R X I I\ncalled to the mighty task of laying the foundations of the\nnew Order, and a better civilization, the Aquarian. For this\nreason, the Masters have decided that Their Work shall be\nknown in the world as THE AQUARIAN FOUNDATION.”\nHarry Strutton, editor of \nThe Occult Review, gave\nWilson his enthusiastic support. In an article written for\nThe Manchester Sunday Chronicle, dramatically headlined,\n“DEVILS MOBILIZING FOR ATTACK, PERIL OF NEW\nARMAGEDDON IN 1928,” Strutton warned that Armageddon\nwas approaching with relentless strides. Fortunately, a new\nmovement had been initiated whose members were enlisting\n“on the side of the angels in this inner and outer warfare\nagainst the powers of hell.” Strutton declared that no living\nsoul would be exempt from the coming conflict, but reassured\nthe public that in the end the forces of light would prevail.\nStrutton also discussed the Aquarian Foundation in several\neditorials in \nThe Occult Review. He wished the new movement\nevery success. “It may be safely predicted, however,” he ob-\nserved, “that its progress will be in direct proportion to the\nfidelity of its adherents to the lofty ideals which seem to in-\nspire it. ‘By their fruits ye shall know them.’”\nr r r\nOne of the most prominent individuals to respond to The\nMessage \nwas a famous English astrologer named Alfred Henry\nBarley. The former sub-editor of the magazine Modern Astrology,\nBarley had worked for many years with Alan Leo, the so-called\n“father of modern astrology.” The bearded and kindly Barley\nwas an outstanding scholar whose book The Drayson Problem\nwas an intricate mathematical proof of a controversial theory\nlinking the Ice Ages to the earth’s rotation. Barley’s wife,\nAnnie, had been a teacher with the London County Council\nfor twenty-eight years, working with handicapped children.\nShe’d also served on the staff of Modern Astrology, and had\n\nMessenger of the Masters 31\nbeen the Secretary of the London Astrological Society.\nThe Barleys lived in Hertford on the River Lea, twenty-\nfive miles north of London. Although not wealthy, they were\ncomfortable. Their home, “Leppington House,” had a fine\nlibrary—Alfred’s prized possession—and the couple spent\nmuch of their time in astrological research and study. They\nwere highly respected by their peers and had even been pre-\nsented to King George V.\nOn September 6, 1926, Barley read A Message from the Masters\nof the Wisdom. He and Annie were Theosophists, but, like many\nmembers of the Society, were dissatisfied with the conduct\nand teachings of the current leaders. \nThe Message struck a re-\nsponsive chord, and Alfred wrote at once, requesting more\ninformation about the Work.\nBrother XII sent the Barleys a paper that explained the\nreason why they’d been so curiously moved by \nThe Message: it\npossessed a “peculiar and magical quality”—it had the power\nof arousing the Intuition:\n“In the world today are many who in former lives have\nformed a link with the Masters, but who have no memory of\nthe fact. These, through past effort or devotion, have earned\nthe right to serve again; they do not know this themselves,\nand we, without personal contact, cannot recognize them. To\nthese \nThe Message comes, arousing the memory of the Ego,\nso that it can directly influence the personality; they feel The\nMessage to be true, though perhaps they do not yet realize why\nit is so. These, the former disciples and servants of the Lodge,\nwill respond—these and none other.”\nThe explanation made sense to the Barleys, increasing their\ndesire to find out more about the Work. They read Wilson’s ar-\nticles in \nThe Occult Review, and at the end of September joined\nthe Aquarian Foundation. In December, they purchased a\ncopy of The Three Truths, which had just been published, and\nfollowed Brother XII’s injunction to the Foundation mem-\nbers: “It should be read and studied by all.”\nBarley and Wilson corresponded at length about the Work,\n\n32 B R O T H E R X I I\ndiscussing a variety of occult topics of mutual interest. Barley\nwas impressed by Wilson’s extensive knowledge and by the\nauthority with which he expressed himself. He realized that\nWilson was a man of formidable intellect, with an absolute mas-\ntery of esoteric matters. Wilson stressed in his letters that the\nnature of the Work was such that no attempt would be made\nto proselytize: “It is not a question of belief or of personal in-\nclinations, but of spiritual affinity, and to which dispensation\nthe individual is karmically linked.”\nWilson emphasized that the Work had no connection with\nany of the “thousand-and-one sects or isms or neo-theosoph-\nical schools. In short, IT HAS NOTHING IN COMMON\nWITH THE EXISTING ORDER, nor with any of its compo-\nnent parts or institutions. It is part and parcel of THE NEW\nORDER, of that which has yet to be revealed.\n“Those who have a part in it belong spiritually and psychi-\ncally to a future day and generation; they have been chosen in\npast Ages, and are dedicated to a definite end and aim. They\nare the nucleus of nations yet unborn, a little band chosen and\nselected by the Great Ones, the hope and seed of the future—\nthey form collectively THE AQUARIAN FOUNDATION.”\nWilson had now moved to Southampton, where he’d rented\nrooms in a house at 10 Westwood Road. The Barleys wrote to\nhim there, requesting a personal meeting. To this suggestion,\nhe readily agreed.\nOn January 5, 1927, Alfred and Annie Barley took a bus\nfrom London to Southampton, arriving at Wilson’s lodgings\nat about two-thirty in the afternoon. “He himself admitted us\nat the door,” Barley recalled, “and said that our coming was\nvery important—more important than we realized.” Wilson in-\ntroduced the Barleys to Elma, the same woman who’d nursed\nhim in the South Seas. She was gracious and well-spoken and\nshared Wilson’s interest in Theosophy. Her devotion to him\nwas obvious.\nThe two couples sat around the fire and Wilson talked\n\nMessenger of the Masters 33\nabout The Message and the ruin which was shortly to fall upon\nEngland. He advised the Barleys to liquidate their securities\nand re-invest in Canadian securities, since they would depre-\nciate less than any others in the coming financial debacle.\nWilson told the Barleys he intended to go to British Columbia\nin a few months to establish the “Center of Safety” referred to\nin \nThe Message. He spoke as if he took it for granted that the\nBarleys would join him there later.\n“The conversation flowed on in such a way,” Barley recalled,\n“that references to the subject of our own personal emigra-\ntion were not direct and specific as they would have been in a\nshipping agent’s office, but were more or less casual and inci-\ndental, as they would have been at a friend’s supper table.”\nDuring supper, Wilson read the Barleys a “Special Urgent\nLetter” that he was sending to all the members of the\nFoundation:\nThis Letter is not concerned with moral or spiritual\nissues, but is entirely practical. This people is shortly to pass\nthrough great tribulation, and warning is given, so that\nthose who heed it may remove to a place of safety. To do\nso is not “selfish”: those who personally avoid the trouble\nmay be able later to help a Brother less fortunately placed.\nIf you remain, all may be lost—even the chance of helping\nothers. . .\nA small settlement is to be prepared in British Columbia.\nThere are others, but this is the nearest and most suited to\nEnglish people. It will be the first to be developed. Instruc-\ntions as to ways and means will be given to those who are\nprepared to act. . . You should ACT now, and save what\nyou can. If to sell now means considerable loss, not to sell\nmeans total loss in the near future. Every pound saved from\ndestruction is one more pound available for the work of\nreconstruction later. . . If you feel that such action is too\ndrastic, remember that the existing order is about to disap-\npear. You and yours, and all that you have, will almost\n\n34 B R O T H E R X I I\ncertainly disappear with it. . .\nThe letter charged every member to observe complete si-\nlence in the matter: “Should you wish to warn friends, you\nmust do so as if expressing your personal views and opinions\nonly. Any departure from this course would be a betrayal of\nthe confidence placed in you. By creating the tendency to\ngeneral panic, it would jeopardize the opportunity of all. . .”\nAfter the supper was cleared away, Wilson produced a map\nof Canada. He spread it out on the table and they all gathered\naround. Barley asked where the settlement would be located\nand Elma pointed to the district of Hope, about one hundred\nmiles east of Vancouver, and said to Wilson, “That’s the place,\nisn’t it, dear?”\n“He told us he himself was going out during February,”\nBarley recalled, “and that Mrs. Wilson was to follow him about\na month later, and that he thought a few others would be\ngoing out with her, partly as company and partly in order that\nby travelling together, economies might be effected, especially\nin the matter of baggage and freight. He recommended us to\nstock up with clothing and bedding as these things were dear\nin Canada.”\nLater that evening, a young man named Frederick Pope\ncame in and was introduced to the Barleys as a member of the\ngroup that would be going out to Canada.\nThe Barleys stayed the night, and had breakfast with Wilson\nthe following morning. They’d been very much impressed by\nhis “earnestness,” and by the Work he’d described to them,\nwhich was very much in accord with their own ideals.\nAnnie Barley later recalled: “Before we left, we had almost\nmade up our minds to go to Canada. We left him, saying that\nwe would think the matter over and let him know. I remember\nwhen he saw us to the bus and said goodbye, we were again\ngreatly impressed with his words on parting, which were:\n‘Goodbye—forget everything but the Work.’”\n\nMessenger of the Masters 35\nr r r\nOn January 25, 1927, Brother XII issued a General Letter to\nthe Foundation’s members, announcing that the Master had\ndirected him to go at once to North America to inaugurate\nthe work of the White Lodge there. He would visit both the\nUnited States and Canada, but the work in Canada came first\non his schedule:\n“Commencing in the East, I have to cross Canada, estab-\nlishing this Work and linking all together as I go. At certain\npredetermined points, I hope to meet gatherings of the many\nBrothers who are already looking towards the present Work.\nAt each of these points, I want to leave behind me a strong,\nvirile, united body, a center through which the power of the\nMaster can radiate. Remember, my Brothers, that these will\nbe magnetic centers— one of the reasons why I must come in\nperson is because they can be formed in no other way.”\nHe then addressed the question foremost in the minds of\nmany members, one which had prompted considerable spec-\nulation and debate—the location of the Center for the nucleus\nof the new race:\nYou are all familiar with the idea that North America is\nthe place chosen for the beginnings of the sixth sub-race.\nThere have been many guesses as to what part of North\nAmerica would be chosen—it has even been given out by\ncertain people that California, or lower California, would\nbe selected. North America is a big place, and guesses some-\ntimes go wide of the mark—also the secrets of the White\nLodge are well kept, especially in matters relating to racial\ncycles and development. I may now tell you that there will\nbe more than one Center; one of these \nwill be in California,\nand yet another in Mexico, but these come later.\nThe Center chosen by the Manu (Vaivasvata) to be the\ncradle of the coming sixth sub-race is neither Mexico nor\nCalifornia, but Southern British Columbia. Why? There are\n\n36 B R O T H E R X I I\nmany reasons, one of these being that one of the chief ob-\njects to be attained is body-building, and there we have the\nideal conditions needed for all-round development. This\nis to be THE Center—the first actually to be formed upon\nthe continent for this particular purpose, and from which\nthe material for the nucleus of other Centers will later go\nforth.\nThis locality has been actually and definitely selected—it\nis HIS choice alone, and while it is already known to me, I\nhave not seen it in the physical body as yet. It is in the se-\ncuring of this chosen site that I shall need your help, and\nthe help of our Brothers in the United States—in that and\nin other matters. You have to bear in mind that the place\nnow chosen by the Manu will be not only the Center of the\npresent Work, it will be THE center of spiritual energy and\nknowledge for the whole continent of North America—for\nthe whole world in the not distant future.\nBrother XII told the members that much of the Masters’\nwork had already been accomplished on inner planes, and that\nit was now their privilege and responsibility to give it expres-\nsion in the outer world. They would each become channels\nfor the power and knowledge of the Masters, working with\nthem for the aid and blessing of mankind:\nMy Brothers, I do not have to tell you that this is a great\nvision; it is the greatest vision in the world today—the vision\nof the new Age. Already others have caught glimpses of it\nand are trying to give expression to it through ideas and\ndevices of their own. But that is not our way because to us\nit has been given to follow and to work with Those Who\nare the Originators and the true Executors of the Plan.\nThat is the vision as it has been shown to me; make it your\nown, consecrate your lives to it: then shall we see its form\nand fruit upon the physical Earth—the counterpart of that\npattern eternal in the Heavens.\n\nMessenger of the Masters 37\nYour Brother in Service,\nXII\nThe Barleys, meanwhile, had decided to go to Canada and\nbecome members of the new community. They liquidated\ntheir assets, selling their house and Alfred’s library. They were\ndisconcerted when they realized that after all their expenses\nhad been paid, they only had fifteen-hundred pounds left.\nThe Barleys wrote to Wilson, advising him of their prepa-\nrations and asking him how they should address their luggage.\nThey were surprised when he wrote back and informed them,\nwithout further explanation, that their destination was, not\nHope, but a small coal-mining town on Vancouver Island\ncalled Nanaimo.\n“It is significant of the ascendancy he had gained,” Barley\nlater commented, “that we accepted the alteration without\ndemur, assuming that plans had to be changed owing to cir-\ncumstances beyond our control.”\nThe Barleys had been led to expect that a fairly large con-\ntingent would be going out to Canada. They were surprised,\nagain, to learn that only two other individuals besides them-\nselves and Elma would be making the trip: Frederick Pope\nand an eccentric ex-British Army captain named Sidney Sprey-\nSmith. Wilson, however, didn’t seem dismayed by the size of\nthe group, nor by the fact that there hadn’t been a wider gen-\neral response to The Message:\nAs was foreseen, very few responded, for people as a\nwhole in Great Britain must pass through ‘great tribula-\ntion’—the harvest of individual and national karma. The\nwork in Great Britain has been the throwing of a life-belt to\na few. Also, we must remember that this Work is primarily\nconcerned with North America, not with Europe, for it is in\nAmerica that the new sixth sub-race type is to be developed.\nAlready, and before I have as yet set foot in North America\non the business of the Lodge, there has been a great re-\n\n38 B R O T H E R X I I\nsponse there. In the United States and Canada, no less than\nseven organizations have aligned themselves with this Work.\nWilson also didn’t hesitate to make some bold claims for\nthe spiritual agents who stood behind the Work: “The Masters\nM. and K. H., who founded the early Theosophical Society, are\nactively engaged in it, as is also that Master Whom the Western\nworld knows and venerates as the Christ.”\nIn the third week of February, 1927, Wilson boarded the\nCunard liner \nMontroyal at the Southampton docks. Propellors\nchurning, the great ship cast off her moorings and eased\nout of her berth. Excited passengers crowded the railings to\nwave farewell as the liner turned to face the English Channel.\nBrother XII was on his way to bring the Work of the Masters\nand the Great White Lodge to America.\n\n39\nCHAPTER\nII\nThe Aquarian Foundation\nI\nn Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, the Peace Tower pierced\nthe icy vault of the heavens and the frosty air echoed with\nthe cries of skaters on the Rideau Canal. To the south of\nthe Parliament Buildings, streetcars glided down the frozen\nstreets, stopping to let off groups of muffled passengers. On\nthis typical evening in March 1927, the city was bathed in\nmauve light. A little band of pilgrims—well-educated, cultured,\nand respected members of the community—converged on\nthe Ottawa Lodge of the Theosophical Society to attend a\nspecial event. Tonight, they would hear a talk by a mysterious\nEnglishman who had recently arrived in Canada—Brother\nXII.\nTen days earlier, the \nMontroyal had sailed up the ice-choked\nSaint Lawrence River and docked in Montreal. Brother XII\nhad been enthusiastically received by Theosophical Society\nmembers there, since his arrival in Canada had been heralded\nseveral months earlier when \nThe Message had been printed in\n\n40 B R O T H E R X I I\nThe Canadian Theosophist, the official organ of the Society in\nCanada. In Montreal, Brother XII quickly recruited some of\nthe first Canadian members to the Aquarian Foundation.\nInside the Ottawa Lodge, the air was filled with anticipa-\ntion as the members packed the assembly hall to capacity.\nThey sensed that Brother XII’s talk would be something of\ngreat importance. On one wall, a wooden plaque bore the\nSociety’s motto: “There is no religion higher than truth.” On\nthe other, a portrait of Madame Blavatsky hung, her solemn\ngaze lending an air of purposefulness and credibility to the\nproceedings. Rows of wooden chairs faced the front of the\nhall, where Brother XII sat on a raised platform with the exec-\nutive of the Lodge. All eyes in the hall focused upon the figure\nof the slight Englishman. The president struck a small brass\ngong to start the meeting. At the awaited moment, Brother\nXII rose to speak:\n“Friends, this evening, I shall try to give you a vision, to make\nyou see something of what this Work is to be in the future. In\nthe first place, if you are to see this vision clearly, you must try\nnot to see me. Into my mind, there comes a verse which was\nspoken of St. John: ‘What came ye out to see; a reed shaken by\nthe wind?’ That is a very good simile, for the reed, as you know,\ndenotes weakness, but it is shaken by that which is the oppo-\nsite of weak. What you must do tonight is to try and catch the\nmessage of the Wind, of the one Spirit, rather than to center\nattention on the reed. . .”\nBrother XII went on to outline the Work in general, and\nto talk specifically about the importance of group work in the\nnew era. He told his listeners that the Aquarian Foundation\nwas an actual physical counterpart of the Great White Lodge—\na replica of its organization on the higher planes and that its\nwork would be accomplished by group action, rather than by\nthe action of individuals:\n“At this time, there are in the White Lodge twelve great\ngroups which are specifically concerned with the evolution of\nhumanity. We may say that, in a general sense, these corre-\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 41\nspond in their nature to the twelve astrological houses. The\nAquarian Foundation is especially the work of the ‘Nine’ and\n‘Twelve’ groups. These two groups are always active in periods\nlike the present, the closing of one age and set of accounts\nand the commencement of another. The work of the ‘Twelve’\ngroup is synthetic; its present business is to ‘link and to bind,’\nand the personal use of that numeral in my own case \nis due to\nmy connection with that special Group and its work.”\nBrother XII stressed to his listeners the importance of the\nWork, urging them to come together at once to form groups\nof the Aquarian Foundation—“the time left is terribly short,\nand the work to be accomplished is vast beyond belief.” He\ntold them that the Masters would fill each group with their\nknowledge and power, so that each group member would have\naccess to far greater spiritual force than was available individ-\nually. Groups would act as transformers: they would receive\nenergy from the Masters, then project it outwards as a potent,\npractical force in the world of human affairs.\nBrother XII told his listeners that as members of the\nAquarian Foundation they would constitute a select mental\nand spiritual aristocracy: “You are Knights of the Grail, or of\nthe Round Table. You are pledged to your own Higher Self\nto lead His life, the Higher life—thus shall we carry into the\nworld the tremendous force of Example.”\nAfter his talk, the members crowded around, asking ques-\ntions and seeking to become part of the Work. Brother XII’s\ntalk was so effective that nearly all of the members of the\nOttawa Lodge joined the Aquarian Foundation.\nA few days later, Wilson arrived in Toronto, the stronghold\nof the Theosophical Society in Canada, with more than 250\nmembers. There was tremendous interest in this new “Mes-\nsenger of the Masters,” but Albert E. S. Smythe, the General\nSecretary of the Society and editor of The Canadian Theosophist,\nwas sceptical of Wilson’s claims. He’d sent The Message to sev-\neral old-timers in the Society and published their comments\nabout it:\n\n42 B R O T H E R X I I\n“My opinion of this is that the writer of the circular is a de-\nluded, hallucinated person. . .” wrote one.\n“I would have more confidence in it if it were not advertised\nin \nThe Occult Review,” observed another. “I cannot imagine a\nMaster advertising in a magazine. . .”\nBut in spite of these critiques, Smythe conceded that The\nMessage \nhad “more of the spirit of the early days than anything\nthat has appeared from Adyar [Theosophical Society head-\nquarters in India] in recent years.”\nBrother XII gave several talks to the Toronto Lodge of the\nTheosophical Society. He asked the members to give him their\nsupport in founding a “Center of Safety” in British Columbia.\nHis call to action galvanized the members, many of whom felt\nthat the Lodge had become little more than an intellectual\ndebating society.\nHerbert Jefferson was impressed. A commercial artist and\nactive member of the Toronto Lodge, he remembers Wilson\nas a lean figure with a powerful face and sensual mouth.\n“He propounded this scheme of a ‘zone of safety,’ as he\ncalled it,” Jefferson recalls. “He was also going to start a school\nto train people who wanted to help humanity during this crash\nthat was coming. He was very persuasive. He had his detrac-\ntors, of course, but it sounded alright to me.”\nIn Toronto, Brother XII stayed with George Hobart, an\nadvertising executive and the Secretary of the Lodge. As a sou-\nvenir, he gave Hobart a photograph of himself. Hobart loaned\nit to Jefferson and some other curious members. When Wilson\nfound out, he flew into a rage and demanded the photograph\nback. “My picture is not public property!” he declared. “It is\nto be issued by no one but myself!” Hobart was taken aback by\nWilson’s reaction. The incident, however, did not deter him\nor Jefferson from making plans to move to British Columbia.\nBrother XII spoke to Theosophical Lodges in Hamilton,\nLondon, and Windsor, Ontario. The response was also pos-\nitive. In fact, his trip to eastern Canada was an astonishing\nsuccess—in one fell swoop, he’d captured much of the\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 43\nCanadian membership of the Theosophical Society for the\nAquarian Foundation. This development did not please the\nGeneral Secretary of the Society, Albert Smythe.\nIn Windsor, Wilson spent the day with Joseph S. Benner,\nowner of The Sun Publishing Company in Akron, Ohio,\nand the author of the metaphysical classic, \nThe Impersonal\nLife. A gentle, unpretentious man, Benner was a mystic with\na Christian orientation and a small but devoted following of\nhis own. He offered to publish Brother XII’s writings in the\nUnited States, and discussed with him how to best organize\nthe Work in America. Benner left the meeting convinced that\nWilson’s link with the Masters was genuine.\n“It is most amazing to me to see what has been accomplished\nwithin the short space of six months through the efforts of this\nquiet little man,” Benner wrote to an associate. “I found, of\ncourse, that he has been given to know the whole Plan, but\nthat back of what he himself knows is a great reservoir of knowl-\nedge and power which is poured through him as the need and\ntime manifest. I have no doubt that he will carry through and\naccomplish that which he has been sent out to do, if we who\nalso have the vision prove true and faithful to it.”\nBrother XII now boarded the train for the three thousand\nmile trip across Canada to the Pacific Coast. He planned to\nstop at various places en route to meet personally with readers\nof \nThe Message who had written to him in England. Every pro-\nspective member was important, no whistlestop too small to\nvisit. One can imagine him standing beside the tracks in the\nCanadian Shield, exchanging a few words with a solitary dis-\nciple who had made a special trip to meet the train. Or being\ndriven by burly Saskatchewan farmers to their homes for a hot\nsupper and an overnight stay. Or speaking impromptu in a\ntrain station in the Rockies to a hastily assembled group of ear-\nnest souls. At last, the train rolled into the Canadian Pacific\nRailway Station in Vancouver. Wilson had accomplished much,\nbut he was exhausted from the journey.\nThe following afternoon, Wilson stood on the deck of the\n\n44 B R O T H E R X I I\nPrincess Louise as it plowed through the waters of the Strait\nof Georgia to Vancouver Island. As the ferry slipped past\nProtection Island into the harbour of Nanaimo, Wilson could\nsee the massive chimney of Nanaimo’s largest coal mine, the\nNumber One Esplanade, spewing smoke into the air. Formerly\nthe coaling station for the British fleet in the Pacific, Nanaimo\nhad once exported coal up and down the Pacific Coast, from\nSan Diego, California, to Anchorage, Alaska, and to destina-\ntions as far away as Hawaii, Russia, and China. Seven miles of\ntunnels honeycombed the ocean floor beyond the harbour,\nand miners toiling far out beneath the Strait of Georgia could\nhear the ships’ engines throbbing directly above them as they\nworked. The \nPrincess Louise docked and Wilson descended\nthe gangplank into Nanaimo.\nHe was noticed at once by a local contractor named Daniel\nEgdell, who struck up a conversation with him. When he\nlearned that Wilson needed a place to stay, he arranged for\nhim to rent a house in Northfield, a mining district outside\nNanaimo. And so it was that a small, run-down frame house\nin the middle of a field became the first headquarters of the\nAquarian Foundation.\nA few days later, Wilson sent a telegram to Edward Lucas, a\nVancouver lawyer who’d written to him in England, offering\nhim a place to stay when he arrived. A genial family man and\nlight-hearted spirit, Lucas was an independent thinker, inter-\nested in new ideas. He wired back, telling Wilson he’d meet\nhim the following Sunday in Nanaimo.\nOn March 13, Lucas stood at the rail of the \nPrincess Louise,\nsearching the faces on the dock. “WILL MEET BOAT. WILL\nSTAND WITHOUT HAT,” Wilson’s telegram had read. As\nLucas strode down the gangplank, he saw a “slight, tired, deli-\ncate man” waiting to greet him, with “iron-grey hair brushed\nstand-up pompadour, short clipped beard, very kind, very\ngrave eyes—and such a charming smile.”\nThe rapport between the two men was immediate—they\ntalked for eight straight hours. An ardent sailor and member\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 45\nof the Vancouver Yacht Club, Lucas enjoyed taking a nautical\nline with “The Skipper,” as he was soon calling Wilson. He lik-\nened working with him to being in the navy: “I’m an officer,\nkinda. I’m like a Temporary Supernumerary Acting Oiler’s\nMate. But I’m in the Navy. And War has been declared.” All\njoking aside, Lucas was profoundly impressed by Wilson:\n“I have met a Messenger. . . I have met a direct, personal\nAmbassador of the Great White Lodge. And that’s that!”\nThe following weekend, Wilson visited Lucas at his home\nin Vancouver. Lucas’s legal expertise was an asset. He advised\nWilson to incorporate the Aquarian Foundation as a society\nunder the Societies Act of British Columbia. The two men\nsat down at the dining-room table, rolled up their sleeves,\nand went to work drafting the constitution and by-laws of the\nAquarian Foundation. The Society had four objects:\n1) To give teaching and instructions to its members upon\nphilosophical and occult subjects, and upon all matters con-\ncerning their physical, mental, and spiritual welfare; and to\nprint and publish such books, magazines, or documents as\nmay be necessary for that purpose.\n2\n) To form and operate one or more central communities\nto be conducted upon mutually beneficient and fraternal\nprinciples, and to provide for the education of its members\nand their children in accordance with the general princi-\nples herein laid down.\n3) To provide for the pursuance and carrying out of such\nactions and policies as may be deemed advisable for the wel-\nfare of the society and its members.\n4) To cooperate directly or indirectly with all other soci-\neties, orders, or organizations which are activated by the same\nprinciples of Truth, Justice, Brotherhood, and mutual service;\nto the end that all may share in that greater strength and soli-\ndarity which is the outcome of unity of effort and purpose.\nThe Society was organized around a board of seven direc-\n\n46 B R O T H E R X I I\ntors known as the Governors of the Society—the illumined\nBrothers referred to in The Message. There would never be\nless than seven nor more than twelve Governors, and any deci-\nsions affecting the Society would be arrived at by a vote among\nthe Governors, and would not be dependent upon a vote of\nthe members at large. Ideally, the voices of the Governors\nwould be unanimous, but in the case of a divided opinion,\nthe final decision would always rest with the president of the\nSociety. The constitution made Edward Arthur Wilson presi-\ndent for life; he thus exerted absolute legal control over the\naffairs of the Society.\nWilson stayed overnight with the Lucas family and proved\nto be the perfect house guest. He charmed Lucas’s wife,\nMarion, who was an avid astrologer and found their conver-\nsations fascinating.\n“His voice was a light baritone,” Edward Lucas recalled, “and\nhe spoke with a curious, explosive hesitancy—stabbing at you\nwith the first finger of his slender right hand. After every few\nwords, his voice would rasp. He suffered from angina pectoris\nand took nitroglycerine pills.”\nThe crowded supper table was good-natured bedlam—the\nLucases had five children—as food passed back and forth\nacross the supper table and the adults’ enthusiastic discussion\nof the Work competed with the clatter of dishes and the cries of\nthe children. Lucas chuckled at the idea that Southern British\nColumbia—his own backyard, as it were—had been chosen by\nthe Masters as the cradle of the sixth sub-race and birthplace\nof the Avatar. “We’re really getting in on the ground floor!”\nhe joked.\nHe also felt as if the friendship of a lifetime had blossomed\nin a single weekend. “Strange how we feel like protecting this\nman from harm,” he wrote. “With me, it is a strange uprush of\nlove and loyalty such as I have not experienced in years—forty-\nthree the other day—and I don’t give in to so many raptures\nas I used to. But now, it’s as though I were seventeen again and\nhad just met my best high-school friend. . .”\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 47\nWilson also made time for the Lucas children, letting\nthe younger ones climb up on his knee and play with his\nwatch, and helping fourteen-year-old Frances Lucas with her\nLlewellyn George astrology course.\n“I remember he showed me how to set up a horoscope,”\nshe recalls. “He was being nice to me; just a charming English\ngentleman. But formal—he always kept his tie on! He didn’t\ntalk about anything else but the Work—he was pretty well ob-\nsessed with it.”\nAfter Wilson left, the Lucas family unanimously agreed:\n“You couldn’t possibly find a more friendly and sincere\ngentleman.”\nr r r\nAt twelve noon in the second week of April 1927, Will\nLevington Comfort stood on a dock in San Francisco, waiting\nfor the passenger steamer from Seattle. He’d arrived an hour\nearlier from Los Angeles—an intense wiry man tanned by the\nsun and hardened by hours on the tennis court. A former war\ncorrespondent, Comfort’s stunning first novel, \nRoutledge Rides\nAlone, had been an extraordinary success and hailed by the\npeace movement in the United States. The author of over a\ndozen adventure novels and a frequent contributor to The\nSaturday Evening Post, Comfort was a mystic in the tradition\nof Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter, a man with a pas-\nsionate belief in the spiritual destiny of America. \nThe Message\nhad worked its uncanny magic on him: he’d been spellbound\nby it, and had unhesitatingly surrendered himself and his\ngroup of workers to Brother XII’s cause.\nMonths earlier, Wilson had written to Comfort from Eng-\nland, saying he hoped that the two men could meet in San\nFrancisco at the turn of the new moon in April. Now the\nmeeting was happening to the day.\nThe steamer from Seattle docked with a sharp blast of its\nwhistle and Wilson stepped off. For Comfort, this moment\n\n48 B R O T H E R X I I\nmarked the end of a long search:\n“If you had long been looking for someone, searching the\nfaces of crowds and congregations, peering under the cap\nof the lone passerby . . . if you had looked in vain for him\nat the city gates, where the camels and elephants come and\ngo . . . giving up at last, and turning to find him at your side—\nno giant, no stranger, no king—a voice familiar, a laugh\nidentified again that has never for ages quite died out of the\nheart—a man whose glove fits your hand—”\nComfort was a romantic, but he was also a shrewd judge\nof character. He intended to scrutinize “The Messenger” care-\nfully to see if his actions were consistent with his claims. The\nfirst test came that evening in a San Francisco hotel. In his\nmagazine \nThe Glass Hive, Comfort described the scene:\nThe man is no orator or lecturer. In fact, he has not\nspoken in public more than four or five times in his life, and\nthese were recent affairs while crossing Canada; practically\nvirgin he was, therefore, to meeting a crowd when he faced\nthe turn-out in a San Francisco hotel hall. As he rose, sounds\nof a gala marriage festival began to break in from a banquet\nhall next door. No dry time they were having in there, and\nthe band had caught the spirit. A change of halls was not\nfeasible, and The Brother XII began to speak in an incred-\nible jangle of laughter and jazz. His isn’t a clarion voice, his\nspeech not even oracular. We saw his face set like a swim-\nmer’s in the midst of the surges of distracting sound, and\nheard his words—some of them—the story of the begin-\nnings of the Work, carrying steadily on.\nThe audience was in torment, partly because it was unable\nto hear or fix itself to listen, but mainly in pity for him. Yet\namazement softly grew, for the voice carried steadily on. No\nirritation, no resentment: the steady advance of a man who\nhad long since forgotten how to quit. To most, it would have\nbeen a shattering of inimical force, but this man was quite\nunruffled; his mind, turned inward to listen, did not give ear\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 49\nto outward disturbance. . . until we suddenly realized that it\nwas calm outside, that a battle had been fought and won.\nThe following day, another incident occurred which seemed\na further test of Wilson’s character:\nAmong The Brother XII’s mail when he reached San\nFrancisco was a letter from a magazine editor, intimating\npossibilities of an article from him concerning the nature of\nthe Aquarian Foundation. He considered this of immediate\nimportance, groped his way out of the dim room of a hotel,\nand was sitting bare-headed on the benches of a park—\nUnion Square, in fact—where I found him. He passed over\nto me the editor’s letter and an outline of the article already\nset up. Now it happened that I knew the editor, something\nof the temper of the magazine, and what would happen in\nthe editorial offices if an article like this were turned in. At\nthe same time, when a man is hot in a work, pouring his\npowers into the form, it is about as pleasant a task to tell\nhim he is off the track as to tell a mother her new-born\nshows signs of reversion to type. I handed the paper back,\nwondering how I could side-step.\n“It does not appeal to you as quite the proper way to ap-\nproach them?” he gently questioned.\n“It does not,” said I.\nHe listened carefully. “I am grateful to hear,” he said. “I\nwill try it from a new angle.”\nAn hour or two later, he put into my hands a second bud-\nding manuscript. This time, he had a line on the subject,\nbut his way into it would still make it impossible in that cer-\ntain office in downtown New York. Again, he waited for me\nto speak; again, eagerly listened to years’ experiences boiled\nhard: “Thank you,” he said; “I see it more clearly, and shall\ntry along a slightly different line.”\nA third time, the writing was brought . . . Through timed\nexposures, we are now able to witness the opening of a\n\n50 B R O T H E R X I I\nflower that requires days, magically reduced to a matter of\nseconds on the screen. It was like that, in a way, with the\narticle he was writing. He was able to use the experience\nof another—in fact, the experience of another had flowed\ninto him and become working knowledge in a forenoon.\nThe point of the incident to me was that a difficult situa-\ntion had been passed without the faintest wearing red of\nfriction; no preconception on his part, no attachment to\nhis own ideas, and he classed as an Englishman. This, and\nthe banquet hall incident, made positively electric that day\na later utterance from his lips—and his hand shot out as he\nsaid it: “Brother, there can be no personality!”\nIn Santa Cruz, Comfort and Wilson spent the day with\nCoulson Turnbull. A big white-haired man with a booming\nvoice, the former Chicago policeman was regarded as one of\nthe foremost astrologers in North America. The author of \nThe\nSolar Logos, The Divine Language of \nCelestial Correspondences,\nand a number of important translations of eighteenth-century\nastrological texts, Turnbull had his own publishing company,\nThe Gnostic Press. He was acting as the Western Divisional\nSecretary of the Aquarian Foundation and vigorously pro-\nmoting Brother XII’s work among his numerous clients.\nBrother XII had brought with him on the trip the Act of\nIncorporation that he and Lucas had drawn up in Vancouver.\nTurnbull signed it, as Comfort had done before him. Wilson\nhad told Lucas earlier that they had to have the actual signa-\ntures of the Governors on the document “for occult reasons.”\nTurnbull’s appointment as Governor brought the number to\nfive, including Wilson himself, Joseph Benner, Edward Lucas,\nand Will Levington Comfort.\nFrom Santa Cruz, an excited group breezed down the\nPacific Coast, stopping every so often to meet other Founda-\ntion members in places like Monterey, San Luis Obispo,\nOceano, and Arroyo Grande.\n“We drove down from Arroyo Grande to Los Angeles,”\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 51\nComfort reported in The Glass Hive, “and he was not in the\nleast dismayed by some fast going, relishing it keenly when\nwe touched sixty-five. I counted it a most valuable point that\nhe did no front or back-seat driving of any kind—a ready and\nracy human being who would rather eat a cracker or two in\nthe open than the best of dinners in a restaurant. So long as\nthere’s tea . . .”\nIn Los Angeles, Brother XII stayed with Comfort at his home\nat 5336 \nAbbott Place, meeting Comfort’s wife Penelope and\nhis recently married daughter, Jane Comfort—also a writer.\n“Everybody loved him,” Jane recalls. “He was stimulating\nand wise, and always spoke carefully and with sensitivity. He\nwasn’t overbearing—if he’d acted like an authority, he would\nhave been much less appealing. But you felt his presence—he\nwas carrying a lot of voltage!”\nDuring his stay, Brother XII gave a number of talks at\nComfort’s home. He spoke to small groups and to people in-\ndividually if they wished to have a private audience with him.\n“When I went in to see him,” Jane Comfort remembers, “he\nasked me, ‘Do you have any questions?’ I said, ‘No, I have no\ndoubts.’ He talked on for a while, then he leaned forward and\nkissed me on the cheek. The kiss was lovely—it was very pure.\nIt was a tribute, really. ‘Steve will not mind that!’ he said, refer-\nring to my husband. Then he took me by the shoulders and\nlooked straight into my eyes. ‘You are a living flame of Truth!’\nhe said, practically shaking with the intensity of his emotion.\nThen he let me go. ‘Now, go!’ he said. \n‘Go!’ And he practically\nshoved me out the door!”\nComfort and Wilson spent a great deal of time together.\n“They were marvelously and deeply drawn to each other,”\nJane recalls. “They were simply—‘Brothers.’” Through hours\nof discussion, Comfort learned more about the experiences\nwhich had shaped Wilson’s character:\n“He has been a great deal apart, many years at sea. He has\nlearned the coasts of the continents as many of us have learned\nthe cities and plains and mountains. He has dealt with con-\n\n52 B R O T H E R X I I\ntours—even entering the tiny, stillest inlets. He is equipped\nwith a strange, almost uncanny knowledge of boundaries, yet\nat the same time his sentiency is literally alive at the heart of\nthings. . . He has known the childish ache for understanding\nand the bitterness of puritanical repressions, known the dis-\nsatisfaction of nomadic wanderings—the outcast on life’s\nhighway ceaselessly ‘moved on’ by Karma. . .”\nA frequent visitor to the house during Wilson’s stay was\nBaron Maurice Von Platen, a wealthy German-American who\nhad retired to Pasadena with a sizeable fortune. Von Platen,\nwho had made his money in the lumber business, was a philan-\nthropist. He had turned his factory over to his workers when\nhe’d retired, and his hobby was building pipe organs, which\nhe donated to churches. Von Platen was interested in applying\noccult laws to the world of business in order to improve social\nconditions. He and Wilson conferred at length during their\nwalks around the property, and Von Platen became the sixth\nGovernor of the Aquarian Foundation.\nSome of Comfort’s other friends were less taken with Brother\nXII. Manly P. Hall, the highly respected occult scholar and\neditor of the journal \nThe All-Seeing Eye, wrote to Comfort: “No\none should be in a hurry to go forth serving humanity, lest in\nhis impetuosity he destroy others and himself with them. The\ngroundwork should be laid first . . .”\nAlice Bailey, head of the Arcane School and a disciple of the\nMaster Djwhal Khul, who dictated Initiation, Human and Solar\nto her, also wasn’t prepared to endorse Brother XII uncondi-\ntionally. She wrote to Comfort that while she was sympathetic\nto the aims of the Aquarian Foundation, her organization\nwould only recognize it as a divinely inspired group “when it\nhas proved its value and established its position other than by\nproclamation.”\nBut in spite of the critics, Brother XII’s California trip\nhad been a resounding success. Many new groups had been\nformed and the interest in the Work was intense—in the five\nweek period before and after Wilson’s visit, Comfort had sold\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 53\n300 copies of The Three Truths from his book room alone.\nWhen the time came to leave Los Angeles, Brother XII was\noffered a ride back to San Francisco by a young bohemian\ncouple. As the three drove north, Brother XII and the girl\ndiscussed astrology—she was a serious astrologer, and later\nmarried the eminent American astrologer Paul Case. They\ncompared their horoscopes and discussed the astrological fac-\ntors governing reincarnation. When the trio arrived in San\nFrancisco, they stayed at the home of the girl’s wealthy mother.\nAfter supper, Wilson and the girl talked late into the night and\nduring their conversation, he made a startling proposition to\nher—he suggested that they have a child together. It would be\na great soul, one of the adepts who was waiting to incarnate to\ntake charge of the Work in the future. He had even calculated\nthe exact moment when conception should occur. The girl\nwas flattered—and shocked. She refused his offer.\nA few days later, Brother XII boarded the steamer to return\nto British Columbia. The girl wrote at once to Jane Comfort,\ntelling her about the incident. Although perhaps not com-\npletely innocent herself—she may have purposefully set out\nto try to seduce Brother XII—she took delight in exposing\nWilson as a fraud and pretender.\n“She felt she was saving us from a charlatan,” Jane Comfort\nrecalls. “She was certain she’d discovered a weakness in him—\na sexual proclivity that would disillusion us all.”\nWill Levington Comfort apparently dismissed the inci-\ndent; he continued to regard Brother XII as “a man beyond\ntampering.”\nr r r\nOn April 30, 1927, the group from England arrived in\nVancouver, where they were met by Wilson and Lucas at\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway Station at the foot of Granville\nStreet. The new arrivals were a motley crew. Barley looked like\nthe typical absent-minded professor, standing with a bemused\n\n54 B R O T H E R X I I\nexpression on his face amidst his trunkloads of books. Annie\nBarley and Elma Wilson were anything but glamorous in their\nstrange hats and dowdy English overcoats. Frederick Pope\nwas frail and shy, and lacked personality. Sidney Sprey-Smith\nwas obviously an eccentric. A bumbling, comical figure with\na pronounced English accent, he kept telling Lucas he was\na Buddhist. Lucas regarded him as “one of the world’s worst\ngod-damn fools!”\nLucas later described the new arrivals in the most unflat-\ntering of terms. Annie Barley was “a crank of the first water,”\nand Elma Wilson “an emaciated old biddy with thin hair and\na look about her resembling a reformed witch.”\nFrom Vancouver, the party proceeded directly to Nanaimo,\nwhere the women set up housekeeping in Northfield. The\ncramped accommodation led to some friction. According to\nLucas, “the two women scrapped continually over who was the\nboss housekeeper.”\nShortly after the group settled in, Wilson decided that the\nAquarian Foundation needed an automobile. He and Sprey-\nSmith returned to Vancouver and set off with Lucas for a used\ncar lot. After looking over a number of cars, they picked out a\nReo touring sedan. Wilson decided to have some fun at Sprey-\nSmith’s expense. He told the salesman that Sprey-Smith was\nan automotive expert and would examine the car.\n“Hrumph, oh yes, a car!” stammered Sprey-Smith. “Well\nnow, let me see, that is a nice car now, isn’t it? Yes, indeed it is!\nHrumph, now I’m supposed to examine the rear-end of this\ncar. Can any of you gentlemen please tell me which end is the\nrear-end?”\nAfter purchasing the Reo, the group began to search for a\nsuitable site for the new colony. One excursion was made to\nan abandoned lumber camp south of Nanaimo, which Wilson\nclaimed to have seen in a vision. It was a logged-over area\nand “bloody desolate,” as Lucas put it, and he was able to talk\nWilson out of it. He was also able to persuade him to drop his\noriginal condition that the site of the colony be exactly twelve\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 55\nhundred feet above sea level.\nAnother trip was made to a piece of land near Mount\nBenson, five miles west of Nanaimo. It too was judged unsuit-\nable, much to the relief of the Barleys, who had “heaved a sigh\nat the thought of having to live in such a desolate and far-away\nspot.”\nIn the middle of May, Wilson learned of some land for sale\nin the farming district of Cedar, nine miles south of Nanaimo.\nThe group climbed into the Reo again and followed the\nVancouver Island highway to the Cedar junction. Turning onto\nHolden-Corso Road, they drove through a pastoral landscape\nof green fields and old farmhouses reminiscent of England.\nThey soon arrived at Cedar-by-the-Sea. Stepping out of the\ncar, they gazed around at the breathtaking natural beauty of\nthe site and unanimously declared, “This is the spot!”\nThe property was partially cleared, but thick stands of\nmaple, alder, and cedar framed a stunning view of the off-\nshore islands. The land sloped to a pleasant shingle beach,\nwhere only a hundred yards offshore, tiny Round Island was\nset like a jewel in the dazzling blue water. Looking through\nDodd Narrows—formed by adjacent Gabriola Island—they\ncould see the waters of Northumberland Channel, which pro-\nvided a protected passageway to Nanaimo.\n“Some lumbering was going forward at the time,” Barley re-\ncalled, “and E. A.W. had his leg rather badly bruised by a log\nbeing dragged against it when the team was turning.” Despite\nthe mishap, everyone felt tremendously elated at discovering\nthe ideal location for the settlement.\nThe next day, Lucas wired Comfort in Los Angeles: “The\nHead Center has been located as was provided in the Master’s\nPlan. It is a place of incomparable beauty on the sea, sur-\nrounded by mighty ranges of green and white mountains, and\nlying snug among the Gulf Islands. It is a magnificent park—a\nfit and lovely setting for the work that is to be done there.”\nOn May 17, Wilson signed a contract with the Western Fuel\nCorporation to purchase 126 \nacres at Cedar-by-the-Sea for $20\n\n56 B R O T H E R X I I\nan acre. The money was to be paid in three installments: $842\nwas paid that day and two installments of $841 each were to\nbe paid, on the same date, in the following two years. The\nWestern Fuel Corporation reserved mineral rights.\nThe money for the first installment was provided by two per-\nsons: one, a civic official from Birmingham, England, and the\nother, Phillip Jutson Fisher, the balding thirty-five-year-old son\nof a wealthy Birmingham manufacturer. Separated and with\na young son in England, Fisher was a manic type: he would\nplay the piano for hours on end, often leaving the impression\nof his sweat-soaked plaid pants on the piano stool. He threw\nhimself into the Work with fierce enthusiasm. Brother XII wel-\ncomed Fisher’s energy and made him the seventh Governor\nof the Foundation.\nEverything was now in place for the work of the Founda-\ntion to begin: the land had been acquired, the Governors\nappointed, and on May 16, 1927—the day before the property\nwas purchased—the Aquarian Foundation was legally incor-\nporated as a society by the province of British Columbia.\nBrother XII wanted to start building on the property\nimmediately, but he lacked the necessary funds. After\ndiscussing the situation with Lucas and the others, he de-\ncided to issue a General Letter to appeal for contributions:\nYour Position—and Ours\nTo all Members:\nWe have to put this work upon a solid basis, and the\nfirst requirement is a suitable place to work, and some tan-\ngible means to carry on that work. We have to establish the\nNorthern Center—that is Foundation work and it must be\nproperly and effectively carried out.\nAt Nanaimo, there are six of us who are giving all our\ntime and all our means to this Work; we are living in a small\nrented house and sleeping two in a room. The living room\nhas been turned into an office, a desk in one corner and\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 57\na multigraph machine in another, and most of the work\nis done on the dining room table. No salaries of any kind\nare paid— our weekly provision bill is divided into six equal\nparts and paid for out of our own slender resources: these\nare coming to an end.\nAbout a month ago, it was proposed to put the position\nfairly and squarely before our members, but this suggestion\nwas disapproved; a request for real help and cooperation\nwas considered to be “Piscean,” i.e. a method belonging to\nan Age and an order now passing away. We do not contest\nthe point, but as most people are using Piscean brains and\nthought-processes, we must use Piscean methods if we are\nto reach them at all. That is common sense. Our work is\nto show them the new method and the new means, but we\nmust begin at the beginning; mental telepathy is still an un-\nknown quantity to most of you.\nOur intention was to ask each member to contribute a\nsmall fixed sum each month—a voluntary offering, and\nwithout obligation. Again, this was objected to in certain\nquarters; we were told, “The Masters do not ask for money.”\nIn reply to this, our Brother E. A. Lucas of Vancouver said:\n“No, but the carpenters and plasterers and plumbers do.”\nHe prepared a frank statement of the case to put before you\nall, but this also was disapproved and again we did not press\nthe point. What we have done so far has been made possible\nonly by the generosity of TWO of our members—two out of\nmany hundreds. It is now necessary that we put the position\nbefore you immediately and exactly—we believe that all will\nrise to the occasion if they understand the need.\n(1) We have purchased 126 acres of land; one third is paid\nfor, the balance is still unpaid and must be made secure.\n(2) We have let the contract for fencing, $450, and the\nwire and other materials will cost about the same again.\n(3) The Center Building will consist of a general office,\nsmall office, lecture-room, lobby, book-room, and six small\nrooms for workers. This will cost $4,500 at the lowest. Today,\n\n58 B R O T H E R X I I\nI have to order a thousand dollars’ worth of lumber and to\npay cash for it—we have not got a thousand dollars. In ad-\ndition to this, we need a large tank for central water supply,\na furnace for central heating; we have to build a garage and\nother out-buildings. These are the barest actual require-\nments and allow nothing for office furnishings, etc.\nTo establish our Center will cost not less than eight\nthousand dollars: if eight hundred members will give ten\ndollars each it can be done, but some will be unable to do\nso; therefore, if you have freely received, then freely give.\nThe Aquarian Foundation is not ours individually, yet we,\nas individuals, have had to contract liabilities for you all.\nSomeone must be responsible, for workmen and firms will\nnot deal with aspirations or helpful thoughts for currency—\nthey need cash. Having thus explained the need, we believe\nthat each of you will do his part, even as we strive to do ours.\nIt calls for some personal sacrifice, but that is the duty and\nprivilege of every disciple. This is a statement of facts; the\nappeal to help will come from the highest in yourselves—\ndo not turn from that inner self.\nDonations for the Center Fund should be by check or\ndraft to either of the following names:—Maurice Von\nPlaten, 1091 Oak Knoll Avenue, Pasadena, California; J. S.\nBenner, The Sun Publishing Company, Akron, Ohio; or to\nThe Aquarian Foundation, P.O. Drawer 23, Nanaimo, B. C.,\nCanada. LET THE WORK GO FORWARD.\nThe Brother, XII\nThe appeal for funds brought a generous response from\nthe membership, although it upset some members who felt\nthat funds shouldn’t be solicited in such a manner. Wilson re-\nplied by saying that the appeal had been sanctioned by the\nMasters, that it was necessary, and that—perhaps most impor-\ntantly—it had generated results.\nHis sensitivity to the criticism is evident in a thank-you note\nhe wrote to a member who contributed ten dollars:\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 59\nDear Brother,\nOur grateful thanks for your donation for our Center\nBuilding Fund. If others do their bit in a like spirit, we shall\nbe able to provide for the physical and material needs of\nthe Work. One of the favourite devices of the enemy is to\nspread the fallacy that the Work of the Lodge can be organ-\nized and accomplished on earth without material support.\nThey cannot defeat our work on the higher planes, so they\nplot to cripple it outwardly and financially. This they do\nby sophistry, branding any outer need as the hallmark of\ninsincerity.\nYours in Service,\nThe Brother, XII\nConstruction proceeded rapidly over the next several\nmonths. The site was cleared and the foundations laid for the\nCenter Building. Lumber was hauled to the property on scows\nfrom the mill at Chemainus, and carpenters framed up houses\nfor Wilson, Fisher, and the Barleys. A Delco power plant was\ninstalled; wells were dug and a water tower built. The entire\nproperty was fenced, and ten-foot-high gates were raised at\nthe entrance.\nThe Lucas family moved from Vancouver to Cedar-by-the-\nSea for the summer holidays, putting up two large tents in a\nlovely grove of maples. Lucas placed a wooden sign over one\nof the tent flaps, “CAMP EARLY DAWN,” choosing the name\nbecause it was the early dawn of the Aquarian Foundation.\nPhillip Fisher noticed the sign and in the same spirit named\nhis house “SUNRISE.”\nIt was an idyllic time for the Lucas children. They played\non the beach and swam every day. Wilson’s elderly neighbour\nGeorge Fiddick kept sheep, which often ran wild on the prop-\nerty before the fence was built—to the great delight of the\nLucas children. “We used to chase one cranky old ram named\n‘Shorty,’” Frances recalls. “But whenever the sheep came on\nthe property, Mr. Wilson would get very angry indeed!”\n\n60 B R O T H E R X I I\nThe land at Cedar was originally the home of the Cowichan\nIndians. The line of clam shells in the cliff marked the site of\nthe midden, while the petroglyphs carved in the rocks outside\nthe Center Building were evidence of an even earlier Indian\nculture. According to legend, five Indian nations had met on\nthe site to end their tribal wars (the word “Nanaimo” is de-\nrived from “Sne-ny-mo,” meaning “the whole” or “a big strong\ntribe”). The land at Cedar had become known as a place of\npeace, a sanctuary where no evil spirit could dwell. In the eve-\nnings, the Lucas family would sit on the wooden platform in\nfront of their tent and gaze out across the clearing. Their dog,\nWiggles, would cock his head, prick up his ears, and peer in-\ntently into the dark. “We’d all laugh,” Frances recalls, “and say,\n‘Wiggles is seeing the Indians!’”\nWilson was well liked by the workmen. “The old man was a\nperfect gentleman,” recalls Dick Nicholson. “ ‘Could we build\na fence?’ ‘Sure, we’ll build you a fence!’ We built that fence in\na month—840 rods around the property, sixty-five cents a rod.\nHe never flickered once about wages.”\n“I can see his face plain as day,” recalls another. “I used to\ncall him the little bantam rooster—short, but just the same,\nhe was a smart bugger! He knew about that big rock city in\nAustralia, those tunnels in South America. He’d been every-\nwhere. He was a skipper—slave-ships. He told me they had\nbarbed wire on the decks all around the boat.”\n“They had a young Chinaman named Git working for\nthem,” another workman recalls. “I went to get some wedges\nfrom Wilson. He asked this Git, ‘Where are those hammers\nand wedges?’ He’d left them somewhere. Oh, he raised hell!\nHe called him a slant-eyed, yellow-bellied Chinaman— or\nwords to that effect. \n‘You get them right now!’ he said. I guess a\nChinaman was pretty low to him, but it seemed strange—the\nleader of an organization like that, and here he was cussing\nhis head off!”\nLucas was amused rather than puzzled by Wilson’s idio-\nsyncrasies. “He used to drive the Reo at an alarming speed,”\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 61\nFrances recalls. “Daddy used to laugh; ‘Oh, you should have\nseen the Skipper,’ he’d say, ‘sitting up there behind the wheel,\nwith his beard sticking up in the air!’”\nWilson had two twenty-eight-foot sailboats built in Victoria—\none for himself and the other for Phillip Fisher. They were\nbuilt from his own design, since, as Lucas put it, he considered\nhimself “the dean of naval architects.”\n“Another one of my father’s nicknames for him was\n‘Frankie,’” Frances explains, “because he was Francis Drake in\nhis last incarnation. And I think Phil was Walter Raleigh.”\n“He knew his onions when it come to sailing,” one workman\nrecalls. “Did he ever! We’d go off to Valdes just for the heck\nof it. It didn’t seem to matter to him that my pay was running\non.”\n“He liked to be on the water,” says another. “If you were\nsteering his boat, he’d tell you which way to go. He’d say,\n‘Don’t hit rocks and don’t hit bottom.’”\nWilson’s relationship with Elma was a subject of specula-\ntion. Although not legally married, they’d been together for\nabout fifteen years. A librarian by profession, she had followed\nWilson around the world, a steadfast and loyal mate. Despite\nLucas’s unflattering description, she had lovely eyes and was\ngracious and well-spoken. She was a bluestocking, prim and\nproper, “the soul of respectability.”\n“We had the notion he was kind of henpecked,” Frances\nLucas recounts. “He hinted that she wasn’t an easy person to\nget along with. I remember him saying to my father that she\nwas a wife in name only, that sex constituted no part of their\nlife together.”\n“She was very prudish,” recalls a woman whose mother and\ngrandmother both knew Elma. “When they were building the\ncolony at Cedar, she told my mother, ‘We don’t have locks on\nall the doors yet. We have a sign we put outside the bathroom,\nbut I’m terrified of anyone coming in and seeing me in my\nknickers!’”\nBut in spite of their differences, Wilson and Elma treated\n\n62 B R O T H E R X I I\neach other with respect and consideration. “Mrs. Wilson\nalways referred to him as ‘The Brother,’” adds the woman.\n“My grandmother would say, ‘Don’t say that; you mean, Mr.\nWilson.’”\nr r r\nDuring the summer of 1927, the Foundation’s member-\nship rapidly increased. The Aquarian Foundation: A Movement\nfor the Unification of All Men of Good Will was published by\nJoseph Benner’s Sun Publishing Company. A forty-eight page\nbooklet, it contained \nThe Message, as well as Brother XII’s gen-\neral letters from England, and included an application blank\nfor those who wished to become “active servers in the greatest\nof all WORK—the saving of humanity.” Individuals who joined\nthe Society were put in touch with other members in their\narea. By the end of the summer, about 125 groups, composed\nof ten members each, had been formed in the United States\nand Canada.\nFoundation Letters and Teachings was also made ready for\npublication. It was a collection of Brother XII’s letters, articles,\nand teachings, and featured an introduction by Will Levington\nComfort. Comfort described the first eighteen letters in the\nvolume as “the burning words of one freshly emerged from\na vision of the Plan. . . They carry the very light of Contact—\nfrom a personality aligned, inspired. We now read in them the\nStory of the Age, of all ages—the drama of an individual called\nto specific action for the whole of humanity.” Five thousand\ncopies of \nFoundation Letters and Teachings were published. It\nbecame the bible of the Aquarian Foundation, referred to con-\nstantly by members on matters of doctrine.\nFrom all across North America, letters began pouring into\nthe Foundation headquarters. Edward and Marion Lucas\nhelped with the flood of mail. Wilson would read each letter\nand write instructions in the margin for how it should be an-\nswered. Lucas would then dictate a reply to Marion. Wilson’s\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 63\nmargin notes were often amusing, sometimes sarcastic. When\na Vancouver group secretary informed him she planned an-\nother visit to the colony, he scribbled “God help us!” And\nwhen she told him she was using group meetings to pray for\na sick member, he instructed Lucas: “Tell her this Work has\nnothing to do with personalities—she is utterly wrong to intro-\nduce such an element into a group meeting—it is not a glory\nhallelujah outfit. She will have to change her views and \nactions\nentirely. Tell her so.”\n“Brother XII has asked me to reply to your letter,” Lucas\ntactfully answered. “He wants me to remind you that we should\nnot concern ourselves, as groups, with the personal problems\nor difficulties of anyone. One of the earliest and most em-\nphatic pronouncements with respect to the Work was that in\nit, there can be no personalities.”\nLucas also explained to members who had been accus-\ntomed to receiving personal replies from Brother XII that the\npressure of his work now made this no longer possible: “This\ndoes not mean that The Brother XII ceases to take a personal\ninterest in those he has formerly corresponded with; it means\nthat his time and energy belong to this Work as a whole, and\nat present, he is very intensively engaged.”\nr r r\nIn a remote part of the estate at Cedar-by-the-Sea, a figure\nin a brown monk’s robe glided silently through the patches\nof afternoon sun and shadow that dappled the forest floor.\nPassing beneath the dogwood blossoms that studded the\ngreen canopy above, it followed a winding path that led down\ninto a wooded ravine. At the end of the path a small cabin\nstood nestled in a grove of maples. Taking a key from the folds\nof its robe, the figure unlocked the door, stepped inside and\nlay down upon a narrow cot. Night soon fell. As the trees glim-\nmered in the moonlight, the figure lay motionless in a state\nof deep meditation, its consciousness transcending mortal\n\n64 B R O T H E R X I I\nembodiment until it merged with the Absolute.\nSo might one imagine one of Brother XII’s periodic\nretreats into the House of Mystery. The little cabin in the\nwoods had been built especially for Brother XII’s use; it was the\ncolony’s \nsanctum sanctorum, and the disciples were forbidden\nto approach it, lest their vibrations disturb Brother XII’s med-\nitation. The House of Mystery was where he experienced\nsamadhi, the highest state of consciousness that an individual\ncan achieve.\nInside the House of Mystery, Brother XII also received his\ninspired writings, as well as instructions from the Masters of\nWisdom for carrying out the Work. An important prayer that\nhe’d received in this manner was “The Invocation of Light,”\nwhich he claimed to have “recovered” at 5:00 A.M., April\n27, 1926: “This is the Great Invocation repeated daily in the\nTemples for thousands of years.”\nTHE INVOCATION OF LIGHT\nO Thou Who bringest the Dawn,\nWho renewest the day without ceasing,\nWhose splendour is the Brightness of the Morning;\nFountain of Life and Source of Light Eternal,\nIncrease in us Thy Knowledge and Thy Strength.\nThou Who shinest in the East,\nWho showest the West Thy glory,\nAnd art supreme in the high heaven;\nThou fillest Thy Houses with Light,\nAnd Thy Mansions with hidden Power.\nThou sustainest the Seven Lords,\nThe Shining Ones Who keep Thy Path,\nAnd we, who serve Thee through Their Ray,\nO Light ineffable.\nIncrease in us Thy Wisdom and Thy Power,\nDwell Thou in us, as we are One in Thee.\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 65\nIn a General Letter issued to members in July 1927, Brother\nXII announced that he planned a one week retreat into the\nHouse of Mystery:\n“The time has come when he whom you know as The\nBrother XII must take another step, withdrawing for seven\ndays from outer contacts. From sunset on the 14th until sun-\nrise on the 22nd of July, give much time to Silence; in that way,\nyou too may benefit from the Work which will then be done.”\nOn the morning of his retreat, Brother XII joined the\nLucas family on the wooden deck in front of their tent. He\nwas wearing a brown monastic robe. He told them he would\nfast for the entire seven days. After having a last cup of tea with\nthem, he bid farewell and vanished into the forest.\nThe days passed and everyone assumed the retreat was\ngoing well. One afternoon, Edward Lucas and Fred Pope\nwere walking in the woods some distance from the House of\nMystery when they heard the sound of sun-dried twigs snap-\nping underfoot. Thinking that an intruder had scaled the\nfence surrounding the property, they quickly hid. A moment\nlater, Brother XII appeared, hurrying along in a most earthly\nmanner. Lucas and Pope looked at each other in astonish-\nment. Wilson didn’t see them and continued on his way,\nplowing through the underbrush.\n“Well, one thing’s certain,” Lucas snorted. “The old man’s\nin no trance!”\n“We’re not supposed to see that,” whispered Pope.\nA few days later, pale and drawn, Brother XII appeared at\nthe Lucas tent. He asked Marion Lucas to make some custard\nfor him, which he greedily devoured.\nBrother XII announced to the members that the retreat\nhad been a success. He had passed the “Fifth Initiation.”\nHe celebrated the attainment of his new occult status in the\npoem “Greeting.” Two of the stanzas describe his ordeal of\ninitiation:\nAnd now this body!\n\n66 B R O T H E R X I I\nSeven times seven years have I trained it, taught it,\nUrged it to effort, tried it to the limit of its strength.\nKnowledge I gave it—a little at a time,\nAnd as the brain could bear it.\nWith my aid, it climbed steps—easily,\nFor I had known and climbed them long ago.\nFour Gates I opened for these, my new bodies,\nLifting the latch easily, and passing through.\nNow, almost within the hour, the Fifth Gate passed.\nThat body which was mine in part\nIs now mine utterly.\nThrough the Dark Valley it passed,\nStraight on, unwavering, fearless.\nFire, Water, Earthquake, Whirlwind –\nAll these it has passed unshaken,\nThe Great Ordeal –\nThe Ordeal of utmost surrender,\nOrdained since the beginning of Time –\nIs passed. . .\nThree days after Brother XII’s retreat, the Governors as-\nsembled at Cedar for the first annual General Meeting of\nthe Aquarian Foundation. It was held on July 25, Wilson’s\nbirthday. Will Levington Comfort, Coulson Turnbull, Maurice\nVon Platen, and Joseph Benner each arrived from the United\nStates to attend, joining Wilson, Lucas, and Fisher. It was the\nfirst time the seven Governors had all been together at the\nsame time. The object of the meeting, as Comfort saw it, was\nfor each Governor to break through “to that plane where our\nseparate rays converged.”\nThe evening before the meeting, six of the Governors\ntalked quietly together outside the Center Building, and\npassed around the galley proofs of \nFoundation Letters and Teach-\nings. “Our remarks were very casual,” Turnbull observed. “We\nspoke of the nimble, clear and pungent style of our Brother’s\nwritings, the creative vitality in the almost magical words; his\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 67\nability—we never doubted it—to execute the monumental\ntask he had undertaken, and the swift and striking achieve-\nments already accomplished.” In the deepening twilight, the\nsix fell silent as they contemplated the beauty of the islands.\nThe sound of the waves breaking on the shore drew them into\nmeditation. Brother XII appeared unexpectedly. “He greeted\nus,” Turnbull wrote, “and we were greatly touched with that\n‘Greeting.’ Half-reflected or unreflected memories of the Past\nbecame ours. The Brother had attained the vision. Could he\nimpart it to his lay Brothers? A little girl played innocently in\nand around the Seven, unconscious of the solemnities. ‘God\nlove her.’ A new rhythm of unfoldment was born.”\nThe day of the General Meeting, Wilson arose early. Today\nwas his forty-ninth birthday, and he had every reason to feel\nsatisfied by what he’d accomplished in the past twelve months.\nThe colony had been only a dream then; now the large Center\nBuilding was almost completed, and he was the leader of one\nof the fastest growing spiritual groups in North America. It\nwas a remarkable achievement.\nLater that morning, at eleven o’clock on a perfect summer’s\nday, the Governors and members of the colony gathered to-\ngether on the grass under a great oak tree, which spread its\nbranches over them like a protective canopy. Brother XII wel-\ncomed everyone to the meeting. After a few introductory\nremarks, he gave a short address, explaining the significance\nof the occasion. The destiny of mankind was guided by an as-\nsociation of highly evolved Spiritual Beings, he stated, known\ncollectively as the Great White Lodge. These Beings worked in\ngroups, many in number and almost infinite in their activities,\nbut of these groups, twelve were especially concerned with the\nevolution of humanity and of the planet:\n“Each of these twelve groups of Spiritual Beings have— or\nwill shortly have—a focal point upon the physical earth; that\nis to say, will function through an incarnated physical body, so\nthat there will be twelve men, in the literal human sense, who\nwill in themselves embody the knowledge and power of those\n\n68 B R O T H E R X I I\nGroups of Spiritual Beings they represent.\n“Representatives of seven of these twelve groups have al-\nready taken—and are now using—human physical bodies. For\nmany years past, they have schooled and trained these bodies,\nbringing them slowly, gradually, and by devious paths to an un-\nderstanding of Who and What they are. Brothers and Sisters,\nit is my privilege to call together from widely separated points\nthose six representatives of as many Groups now in physical\nembodiment—”\nHe then named the six representatives: Joseph Benner, Will\nLevington Comfort, Coulson Turnbull, Maurice Von Platen,\nEdward Lucas, and Phillip Fisher. These six Governors of the\nAquarian Foundation had been drawn together by a common\ninterest and were working in a common cause, he said, but\ntheir collaboration would go beyond this. They would soon\nbecome conscious Instruments of the Masters. As a result\nof the meeting, their consciousness would be raised and ex-\ntended. Together, the Seven would work as One: “One Spirit,\nOne Mind, One Purpose—Seven Groups working consciously\nthrough seven focal points, with One Mind and to One End.”\nThe purpose of the Work would be fulfilled through the\nmeeting that day, Brother XII declared. It was indeed a his-\ntoric occasion— one for which Earth had waited for thousands\nof years: “Later, when men come to understand its true signif-\nicance, the twenty-fifth day of July in the year 1927 shall be\ncommemorated for long ages to come.”\nWhen the meeting ended, Von Platen asked Brother XII to\nsit with the other Governors for an informal group portrait.\nThe seven men posed together in the shade of the magnifi-\ncent oak. Wilson sat in his shirtsleeves in the center, flanked\nby Benner and Comfort, sunlight dappling his shoulders, his\ntie knotted loosely at his throat. It was one of the few times\nthat he consented to be photographed.\nAfter the picture was taken, Frances Lucas moved among\nthe various Governors, asking them to contribute their sig-\nnatures to her autograph book. Coulson Turnbull wrote a\n\nThe Aquarian Foundation 69\nnote of encouragement to his favourite student, jotting down\nthe aspects for the day: Sun in Leo trine Saturn in Sagittarius;\nSun and Saturn trine the conjunction of Jupiter and Uranus\nin Aries—a Grand Trine.\nFrances approached Brother XII and asked him to sign her\nbook. Taking it from her, he turned to a fresh page and crisply\nwrote: “A little line for Fran to commemorate a great day for\nus all, and for the world at large, from The Brother, XII.”\nThe little group slowly dispersed. They were, they all believed,\nabout to embark upon a magnificent spiritual adventure, one\nthey would remember for the rest of their lives.\n\n70\nCHAPTER\nIII\nEmpire of Evil\nO\nn the first day of August, Edward Lucas climbed into\none of the colony’s rowboats and pushed off from\nshore. It was seven days after the General Meeting,\nand he still felt deeply affected by it. He rowed out into Stuart\nChannel towards the Strait of Georgia, the sun hot on his body\nas he dipped the oars into the glassy green water.\n“I rowed until the horizon was a circle, of which I was the\ncenter,” he later wrote. “The sun in the water slid every which\nway into crazy phantasmagoria, until I could not bear to look\nat it and shut my eyes. The sun went down and I was in the\ncenter of the night. My body, burdened with the past, slewed\nand slumped and failed me.”\nLucas spent the night alone on the water. The next morn-\ning, as he watched the sun rise, he felt a renewed sense of\npurpose:\n“I knew again the Light of Eternal Purpose.\n“I know.\n\nEmpire of Evil 71\n“I know that the wavering reflection of the sun in the water\nis not real. . . I know that all the works and activities of person-\nalities are but the wavering of the sun in water, and have no\nexistence. I may again be defeated and desolate and alone,\nbut I will remember that in my hour of uttermost desolation,\nmy integrity was established at the Center.”\nLucas rowed back to shore, inspired by the experience. He\nlater wrote to Will Levington Comfort: “Do you remember\nwhat Pompey said before his last battle—ringed with spears,\nhis last hope gone? ‘There are two Romes, Metellus: one built\nof bricks by hodsmen; but the Rome we serve glimmers in the\nuplifted heart. Let us not shame that city.’”\nBrother XII had told the Governors they would experi-\nence an expansion of consciousness as a result of the General\nMeeting. Coulson Turnbull, like Lucas, had a visionary expe-\nrience, which confirmed to him that he was Brother IX. Joseph\nBenner also felt his spiritual powers increase. He was certain\nthat “the vision shining brightly before us” would be rapidly\nbrought into physical manifestation.\nWill Levington Comfort, who had some earlier misgivings\nabout Brother XII, wrote that the experience of the General\nMeeting was “priceless. . . not without splendour. In the South\nagain, the air seemed extra clear. . . The Brother’s vibration\n[had] charged us electrically.”\nThe work at the headquarters steadily progressed as summer\nturned to fall. In November 1927, the first issue of \nThe Chalice,\n“The Herald of the New Age,” was published. The content of\nthe Foundation’s monthly magazine surprised many members\nas they realized for the first time that the Aquarian Foundation\nwas a militant political organization with an unusual philos-\nophy. Brother XII’s political beliefs could be summed up in a\nsingle word—\nconspiracy.\nIn his article “What Is the Aquarian Foundation?” Brother\nXII wrote about a grand design which had existed throughout\nhistory to enslave the masses: “Is the financial world the\n\n72 B R O T H E R X I I\nproduct of the servants of God, or the children of Mammon?\nWhat is there that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, near\nor afar, by the hidden hand of finance?” The real rulers of\nthe world, he claimed, were the servants of the Antichrist,\nand they controlled everything—from the price of bread to\nthe policies of nations. “No President is ever elected, or King\ncrowned, no treaty ever signed, or army moved, unless it be\nat the bidding, or at least with the knowledge and consent, of\nthis unseen power which controls prince and president and\npeasant alike.”\nThe modern world, he explained, was almost entirely the\nresult of the successful plannings of a sinister and merciless\npower—an invisible “Empire of Evil.” It deliberately fomented\nhatred and strife among the peoples of Earth, setting labour\nagainst capital, and nation against nation. By skilful manipu-\nlation of the press, it promoted national hatreds, which often\nculminated in war. In order to wage these wars, countries were\nforced to borrow—not paper money, but gold—at high rates\nof interest from those who controlled the supply. No matter\nwhich side won or lost, the interest piled up and the gold-\ngetters secured a fresh grip upon their prey. This same hidden\npower also insisted—again, through a controlled press—on\nthe necessity for huge armaments, which kept the people im-\npotent under the burden of an enormous taxation. The crazy\nemphasis given in the newspapers to “sport,” divorce cases, lost\nheiresses, channel swimmers, and the details of sordid crimes,\nwas part of a deliberate plan to keep the masses blinded with\nnon-essentials, distracted and amused, so that they would not\nthink for themselves and investigate the varied and significant\nmoves of the “Big Steal.”\nBrother XII claimed that this “Empire of Evil” had existed\nfor thousands of years. It was the product of a patience that\ncounted centuries as men counted years. In one form or an-\nother, it had existed since the time of Atlantis. Kingdoms and\nempires rose and fell, but the “Empire of Evil” endured un-\nchanged, its teachings, aims, and methods handed down to\n\nEmpire of Evil 73\nchosen successors from age to age. It had engineered the fall\nof the Roman Empire, the death of Jesus of Nazareth and\nthe corruption of His Teachings. It had produced the French\nand the Russian Revolutions; and Bolshevism—that insidious\nand hateful poison which was undermining all rule and au-\nthority—was its last and most fatal production.\nWhat was the ultimate goal to be attained by this invisible\n“Empire of Evil”? asked Brother XII:\nIt is this: when the peoples of the Earth have been drawn\ninto the net which is spread for them, when the nations\nare bankrupt and disorganized, when the machinery of\ngovernment has failed on every hand, and the masses of\nthe people have been decimated by murderous wars, bled\nwhite and crazed with accumulated miseries; when they\nare unable to resist an open and organized attempt upon\ntheir liberties—THEN will this Invisible Empire step into\nthe light, its own system of government ready-made, all\nwealth and resources in its own control, and will say to the\ndistracted nations: “All your schemes have failed and your\nresources are at an end; therefore, accept our government\nwhich is wise and benevolent and, above all, powerful.”\nResistance will be impossible, and self-interest will dictate\nsurrender; the Invisible Empire will have become visible,\nopenly acknowledged and irresistible, and A WORLD\nDICTATORSHIP WILL BE SET UP.\nBrother XII assured his readers that this “Empire of Evil”\nwould not remain unchallenged. It had been decreed from\nage to age that the forces of light would intervene at the\nmoment when the powers of darkness were near to final mas-\ntery. This divine intervention was once more to be manifested\nin the present day. The Aquarian Foundation was the coming\ninto physical embodiment of those spiritual Beings who would\nsave mankind in its hour of greatest need. As Brother XII ex-\nplained in \nThe Chalice:\n\n74 B R O T H E R X I I\nAt every critical period in world history, certain individuals\nare born into the world with a distinct mission, and further-\nmore, they come fully equipped with the knowledge or the\npower needed for the accomplishment of that mission.\nSuch persons are not ordinary persons in the accepted\nmeaning of that term: they are rather Powers or Potencies\nwhich have taken physical embodiment the better to per-\nform the task allotted to them. They are unmoved by\npersonal power, untouched by the desire for wealth or per-\nsonal possessions, which might deflect them from the path\nmarked out. They shun publicity, and desire only that per-\nsonal seclusion which is an indispensable factor in their\nWork.\nSuch is The Brother XII. . .\nBrother XII concluded that whether men knew it or not,\nthey were rapidly approaching the most terrible conflict in the\nhistory of mankind upon the planet. They were moving swiftly\ntowards the culminating struggle between two great opposing\npowers—the powers of darkness and the forces of light.\nThe final battle was about to be fought—Armageddon.\nr r r\nBrother XII’s beliefs were extreme, but not uncommon for\nthe 1920s. It was the era of trusts and mergers. United States\nSteel, General Motors, and General Electric were only a few\nof the companies formed by gigantic mergers. Oil companies,\nrailroads, banks, food and drug companies had followed suit.\nMerger seemed to have become a mania. Many contemporary\nobservers felt that such concentrations of wealth and power\nhad sinister implications, since a few key individuals could exert\ntremendous control over every aspect of economic life. Many\nof the great mergers were handled by Jewish banking houses,\nsuch as Goldman, Sachs and Company, Lehman Brothers, and\nKuhn, Loeb and Company. The directors of these banking\n\nEmpire of Evil 75\nhouses were suspected of plotting to control world capital,\nand of manipulating international politics in order to achieve\ntheir goal of world domination. This supposed plot was known\nas “The International Jewish Conspiracy.”\nThe major document purporting to expose this conspiracy\nwas the infamous \nProtocols of the Elders of Zion. Allegedly the\nnotes of a secret meeting of Jewish Elders held in Basel,\nSwitzerland, in 1897, \nThe Protocols outlined a program to\noverthrow Christianity through subversion and sabotage,\nand to control the world. Translated into English in 1920,\nthey caused a sensation. American industrialist Henry Ford\nprinted a series of articles based on them in his newspaper\nThe Dearborn Independent, and published them in a book, The\nInternational Jew, of which over a million copies were distrib-\nuted. The Protocols were later discovered to be a forgery, written\nby members of the Russian secret police, but Ford and others\ncontinued to insist they were genuine.\nBrother XII believed in the authenticity of \nThe Protocols,\nusing them as evidence to bolster his own theory of\nconspiracy:\n“This plot is a Jewish plot; it is a small group of International\nJews who control practically every banking house in the world.\nBig business is no longer done by banks, but by chains of\nbanks, and these various chains are all, in their turn, under\nthe control of this one small group of men, whose aim is the\nabsolute domination of the Earth, and the enslaving of every\nnation, every people, every race except their own.”\nIn addition to the Jews, Brother XII believed that there was\nanother force at work which sought to enslave the human\nspirit—the Roman Catholic Church. It wasn’t a religion at all,\nhe argued, but “a system of cruel and relentless political in-\ntrigue, which uses the spiritual aspirations of millions of human\nbeings to its own vile ends.” He chronicled the Church’s\nhistory of intrigue, persecution, and slaughter—including\nthe Gunpowder Plot to blow up the British Houses of\nParliament, the Inquisition with its infamous “Star Chamber,”\n\n76 B R O T H E R X I I\nand the slaughter of thousands of French Protestants in the\nSt. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572. He claimed that\nthe bloody cruelties of Rome— conversion or extermina-\ntion—hadn’t changed over the centuries, and that now the\nChurch had turned its attention to the United States, where\nit was relentlessly pushing forward its plans to “Make America\nCatholic.”\nIn the summer of 1926, a million and a half Roman Cath-\nolics had attended the Eucharistic Congress in Chicago. On\nhis way to the Congress, Cardinal Bonanza, the Papal Legate,\nstopped in New York, where he was received at City Hall with\nall the pomp and ceremony accorded a prince of the Vatican.\nA devout Roman Catholic, Governor Alfred E. Smith knelt\ndown before the magnificently robed Cardinal and kissed his\nring—a public act of obeisance that touched off a storm of\ncontroversy across the United States. Smith was the leading\ncontender for the Democratic presidential nomination; his\nring-kissing raised the spectre of Papal interference in the af-\nfairs of the nation.\nWould a Roman Catholic President not owe a dual alle-\ngiance—to both the United States Constitution and to the\nRoman Catholic Church? The Constitution provided for sepa-\nration of Church and State, and guaranteed religious freedom.\nRoman Catholic doctrine, on the other hand, claimed Church\nsovereignty over the State, and demanded absolute obedience\nfrom its subjects in all matters temporal as well as spiritual.\nWould Alfred E. Smith be able to resist pressure from the\nVatican in matters vital to the interests of the Roman Catholic\nChurch? A prominent Methodist Bishop expressed the pre-\nvailing Protestant sentiment: “No Governor can kiss the papal\nring, and get within gunshot of the White House!”\nWriting in \nThe Chalice, Brother XII warned that if Smith\nwere elected, Mexico would be annexed, Britain financially\ncrushed, and the fate of Protestantism sealed. The presidential\nelection of 1928 would decide not only the destiny of North\nAmerica, but that of the entire civilized world.\n\nEmpire of Evil 77\nThe Republican Party offered no better alternative. In\nWilson’s opinion, Herbert Hoover, the bland and unin-\nspiring Secretary of Commerce, was the instrument of the\nJewish Money Hierarchy, and not the choice of the majority of\nRepublicans. He’d been foisted upon them in the same way\nthat Smith had been manipulated into place by back-room\nparty politics. The people didn’t have any real choice: “Elect\nHoover, and you will be plundered in a thousand ways. Elect\nSmith, and freedom will become only a memory in the land.”\nBrother XII had devised a plan to defeat both Hoover and\nSmith. He would go to Washington, D.C., and form his own\npolitical party. He believed that there were people dedicated\nto the ideals of democracy and freedom who would join him\nin setting up a Third Party. With their support, he would\nachieve political power, and, guided by the Masters, would es-\ntablish “The Kingdom of Righteousness” on Earth.\nr r r\nAt the Aquarian Foundation headquarters at Cedar-by-the-\nSea, snow covered the giant firs. Two figures in heavy overcoats\nmade their way towards the waiting car. Brother XII and Phillip\nFisher were leaving on their long journey to Washington, D. C.\nThe car wound through the winter landscape towards the\nVancouver Island highway. In his luggage, Brother XII carried\n“The Big Document,” his plan for the formation of a Third\nParty in the United States. Copies of it had already been sent\nto all United States congressmen and to key political orga-\nnizers in the Capitol. The Third Party would run its own slate\nof candidates in the upcoming 1928 election. It would be a co-\nalition, drawing together disaffected elements from both the\nDemocratic and Republican parties, as well as other political\nminority groups. Brother XII believed that the immediate for-\nmation of the Third Party was the only hope for the nation—he\nplanned the biggest political upset in American history.\n\n78 B R O T H E R X I I\nr r r\nIn Washington, D. C., President Calvin Coolidge was facing\na crisis. On January 7, 1928, he’d dispatched two battalions of\nmarines to Nicaragua to help the ruling military dictatorship\nput down a popular uprising. Six American marines had been\nkilled in the fighting and twenty-six wounded. The lights in\nthe White House burned late into the night as debate raged in\nthe Senate over the President’s action. Coolidge was accused\nof waging war in Nicaragua without the consent of Congress\nin order to protect American financial interests.\nBrother XII and Phillip Fisher arrived in Washington and\nmet Joseph Benner, who’d come from Akron, Ohio, to join\nthem. The three men discussed strategy in a hotel room, then\nbegan contacting those senators and members of the House\nof Representatives they thought would be sympathetic to\na Third Party. The present crisis only underscored the cor-\nruption of the present administration and the vital need for\npolitical reform. Brother XII planned to exploit the antipathy\nmany Protestants felt towards Roman Catholics. Already, a pro-\ntest movement was building across the United States against\nthe nomination of Alfred E. Smith for president. Political car-\ntoons crudely depicted the New York Governor as the puppet\nof corrupt big city bosses and a willing pawn of the Vatican.\nBrother XII enlisted the support of a number of Protestant\ngroups in Washington. He talked to Gilbert O. Nations, editor\nof The Protestant, who was enthusiastic about the plan for a\nThird Party. He also recruited James S. Vance to his cause.\nA flamboyant former drugstore magnate, Vance edited the\nKu Klux Klan newspaper, \nThe Fellowship Forum. The Klan had\nclaimed five million members at its peak in 1924, and although\nits power had declined, it was still a potent force in American\npolitics. \nThe Forum was publishing front page diatribes against\nSmith’s nomination, and Brother XII arranged to reprint sev-\neral of its articles in The Chalice.\nThe Klan’s unofficial spokesman in Congress, and a key in-\n\nEmpire of Evil 79\ndividual in Brother XII’s plans, was Senator James Thomas\nHeflin of Alabama. A colourful figure in his black Prince\nAlbert frock coat, cream vest, and flowing black tie, “Tom\nTom” Heflin was famous for his fiery oratory, and notorious\nin the Senate for his fulminations against the Roman Catholic\nChurch. He’d repeatedly denounced the Church hierarchy\nfor its interference in American politics—in particular for its\nrepeated attempts to pressure the Administration to invade\nMexico. Heflin had been slandered by the Hearst newspapers,\nand threats had been made against his life. Attacked as a bigot\nand accused of fanning the flames of religious intolerance,\nhe remained undaunted. He claimed to have received thou-\nsands of letters of support from across the United States, and\ndeclared that two-thirds of his fellow senators supported his\nviews in private, but were afraid to speak out in public on such\na controversial issue.\nWhen Brother XII arrived in Washington, Heflin’s denun-\nciation of the Administration’s policy in Nicaragua was on the\nfront page of \nThe New York Times. He accused the Coolidge\nAdministration of being controlled by “the golden wand of\nWall Street,” and charged that American boys were being\nbutchered in Nicaragua so that greedy New York bankers\ncould reap profits from the oppression of the Nicaraguan\npeople. Heflin claimed that an “unholy alliance” existed be-\ntween the “money-changers” of Wall Street and the hierarchy\nof the Roman Catholic Church.\nBrother XII admired Heflin for his fearless political stand.\nThe two men met in the Senator’s cluttered office in the Senate\nOffice Building. They made strange political bedfellows—the\nheavyset Dixie demagogue and the ascetic English mystic. No\ndetails of this extraordinary meeting are known, but in all like-\nlihood, Wilson asked Heflin to be the Third Party candidate\nfor president, no doubt invoking the vision of a stunning vic-\ntory in the 1928 election, and of a Protestant America united\nunder Heflin’s leadership. At the very least, Wilson must have\nassured the Alabama senator that unseen powers would assist\n\n80 B R O T H E R X I I\nthem, crowning their efforts with success.\nOn January 18, Heflin stood up in the Senate and launched\ninto a tirade against the Roman Catholic Church and the\ncandidacy of Alfred E. Smith. “Talk to me about Al Smith!”\nhe thundered in a voice that could be heard in the rotunda\nof the Capitol. \n“He will never be nominated!” In the packed\ngalleries high above the Senate floor, Brother XII undoubt-\nedly nodded his approval as Heflin assailed the secret political\nprogram of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Two hours later,\nhis face dripping perspiration and his big frame quivering\nwith emotion, the Alabama senator finished his oration and\nsat down, exhausted.\nThe Senate chamber was silent. Then all heads turned as\nSenator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas asked permission to\nspeak. Turning to his colleague, he condemned his speech as\nutterly unworthy of a senator. It was the first time any senator\nhad dared to rebuke Heflin. “I have heard the senator from\nAlabama denounce the Catholic Church, and the Pope of\nRome, and the Cardinal, and the Bishop, and the priest, and\nthe nun, until I am sick and tired of it!” exclaimed Robinson.\nHeflin fumed in his seat, while Robinson went on to praise\nRoman Catholics for their contribution to America.\nFinally, Heflin jumped to his feet. He was livid. “I’d like to see\nyou make that speech in Arkansas!” he shouted at Robinson.\n“I’ll make it in Arkansas—and in Alabama, too!” Robinson\nretorted.\n“Yes, and if you do, they’ll tar and feather you!”\nHeflin’s remark brought immediate cries of protest from\nthe other senators, who were appalled by the utterance. The\nSenate was gradually restored to order, but the bitter exchange\nbetween the two senators was splashed across the front pages\nof every newspaper in America. The smoldering religious issue\nhad erupted into public debate.\nTwo days later, at separate times, Heflin and Robinson reit-\nerated their views on religion before the lights and cameras in\na “Movie-Tone” studio in Washington, D. C. In theatres across\n\nEmpire of Evil 81\nthe United States, the American public watched as Robinson\nargued for religious tolerance, while Heflin vehemently de-\nclared he was opposed to having the United States Army fight\nreligious battles in foreign countries. The debate generated\nfurther publicity and served to make religion a major issue in\nthe approaching election.\nAs the “Protestant Crusade” rapidly gained momentum\nacross the United States, there was considerable speculation\nabout its leading spokesman. Was Senator Heflin acting on his\nown, or were his outrageous public performances and inflam-\nmatory speeches masterminded by a sinister influence working\nbehind the scenes? The Catholic magazine \nCommonweal won-\ndered if Heflin’s present attitude in the Senate had been\ncleverly assigned to him by forces which preferred to remain\nincognito. Such forces, if they existed, have never been iden-\ntified. The extent of Brother XII’s involvement with Senator\nHeflin is still uncertain. Six months after his meeting with\nthe Alabama senator, on the occasion of the second annual\nGeneral Meeting of the Aquarian Foundation, he stated:\n“In Washington in January last, I told Senator Heflin to get\ninto the limelight as the champion of Protestantism, and to\nstay there. He has since done that very effectively, and is still\ndoing it. At the same time, I set certain experienced political\norganizers at the work of forming the Third Party, or rather\nat laying the wires for its formation later. That work has also\nbeen done. In other ways, I have worked ceaselessly to make\nthis 1928 campaign appear what it really is—a religious issue,\na struggle between Popery and Protestantism.”\nr r r\nBrother XII was also attempting to start a political organ-\nization in England. Before he left for Washington, he had\nsubmitted an article to \nThe Referee, a politically independent\nnewspaper with a circulation of over a million readers.\n“I have written a BIG article for the leading Sunday news-\n\n82 B R O T H E R X I I\npaper in Britain (at the request of the editor),” he informed\nLucas. “If it is published, and I think it will be, it will cause\nthe most profound effect in that country. In other words, the\npeople of England will themselves take charge, and we shall\nget something done.”\nWhen Brother XII returned to the headquarters, a letter\nwas waiting for him from Albert Laker, editor of \nThe Referee.\nLaker said he’d expected Wilson’s article to treat of occult\nsigns, but had found instead “a frank attack on Roman Cath-\nolics and Jews, and we endeavour in The Referee to avoid any\nattacks on religious bodies.” He told Wilson it was out of the\nquestion for him to publish the article.\nThere was also a letter from Sir Kenneth MacKenzie of\nTunbridge Wells, who’d arranged for Wilson to submit the\narticle in the first place. A renowned engineer who’d played\na key role in introducing electricity into Great Britain, Mac-\nKenzie was one of Brother XII’s most ardent supporters in\nEngland. He expressed his regret at Laker’s decision and sug-\ngested Wilson send the article to \nThe Morning Post, whose\neditor had expressed even stronger sentiments in his preface\nto \nThe Cause of the World’s Unrest. “I might get him to accept\nit, for it ought to be published, and in England, but you do not\nseem now to want my help in any way! You treated me differ-\nently this time last year! No matter, I am still & always with you\nin our MASTER’S SERVICE, whatever happens.”\nSir Kenneth’s letter, with its puzzlement at Brother XII’s\nchanged attitude, should have been a warning to Wilson.\nAlready his arbitrary conduct had alienated Will Levington\nComfort. He’d objected to Brother XII’s money-raising\nmethods, and to his policy of having groups follow exact in-\nstructions from headquarters. The two men clashed outright\nwhen Comfort edited one of Brother XII’s articles for \nThe\nGlass Hive\n. Wilson insisted it be printed without any changes.\nComfort refused—and resigned from the Foundation.\nA saddened Comfort later described the July General\nMeeting at Cedar-by-the-Sea to his daughter Jane in a single\n\nEmpire of Evil 83\nsentence: “We gathered together under a dead tree.” His wife,\nPenelope, was more cryptic: “In Nanaimo, even the sharks are\ntoothless!”\nEdward Lucas was caught in the middle of the dispute.\nComfort urged him to break with Wilson—“He’s not what he\nclaims to be!”—but Lucas wouldn’t hear of it. He was fasci-\nnated by the political aspects of the Work, and besides, he was\nhaving too much fun.\nIn one of the monthly Instructions issued to Aquarian\nFoundation members, Brother XII denigrated Comfort. He\naccused him of using the Work as a means of “enhancing such\nsmall glory as he may have gained by lecturing or the writing of\nbooks,” and said that Comfort’s constant stressing of the per-\nsonal showed that he’d never really understood the purpose of\ngroup work at all: “Personal viewpoint, personal reactions, per-\nsonal ‘clean-up’; thus speaks Mr. Passion-for-the-personal.”\nComfort’s departure caused the members to wonder: Why\nwould a man who’d been such an enthusiastic supporter of\nBrother XII now repudiate him? And Brother XII’s bitter\nattack on Comfort also gave them pause. This split among\nthe Governors did not augur well for the future of the\nFoundation.\nDespite these setbacks, Brother XII pressed on with his work.\nIn February 1928, he received a letter from an eighty-five-year-\nold retired lawyer in Carthage, Missouri, named Oliver G.\nHess. He’d read some of Brother XII’s writings, and wanted\nto contribute twenty thousand dollars to the Foundation. But\nwhen he later vacillated, blaming his infirmities for his failure\nto send the securities, Brother XII dispatched Edward Lucas\nto Carthage to personally explain the Work to Hess.\nLucas and Hess had two things in common: they were both\nlawyers and they both had a fascination with the American\nCivil War. Lucas had a library of books on the subject, and\nHess was a veteran—he’d fought with the Union forces in\nIllinois and been wounded at the Battle of Beverly Ford.\n\n84 B R O T H E R X I I\nLucas spent several days with Hess, explaining the nature of\nBrother XII’s work to him. He told Hess that the entire finan-\ncial system in the United States was built up as slenderly as\na house of cards, and that the whole structure was about to\ncome crashing down. It was too late to prevent the utter finan-\ncial demoralization of the United States, he said, but the work\nof the Aquarian Foundation would prevent the forces of evil\nfrom achieving their ultimate objective of world domination.\nImpressed by the gravity of the situation, Hess promised to ex-\necute a trust agreement, transferring twenty thousand dollars\nin securities to the Foundation.\nIn due course, the bonds comprising “The Oliver G. Hess\nTrust” arrived at the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Nanaimo.\nBrother XII was the sole trustee, authorized to use the funds\nas he saw fit to advance the work of the Aquarian Foundation.\nIn accordance with Hess’s express wish, one set of bonds was\nput aside to provide Wilson with a small, personal income for\nlife, so that his time would always be available for the Work.\nWilson wrote at once to Hess, assuring him that the man-\nagement of the Trust would be “a stewardship that will be very\nsacredly regarded.” He expressed a desire to know more about\nthe lives of Hess and his elderly wife, and invited them to the\nCenter for an extended visit:\n“I cannot bear to think of loneliness touching you, and you\nwill remember that I once said that I thought we would soon\nsee each other face to face. Well! It is on the knees of the\nGods, and you must do as you feel able, but at least I want\nyou to know that this request of mine is from the heart. After\nEaster, the weather will be beautiful, and it is never really cold.\nThis is one of the most \nlovely spots on Earth, and there are\nother things connected with it that you will understand fully\nonly if you can come and see us.”\nWilson also sent Hess a photograph of himself taken in Italy\ntwo years earlier. He told him it was a personal memento for\nhim alone, and asked him not to show it to others:\n“Personalities are the bane of this and every other work, and\n\nEmpire of Evil 85\nso far as I am concerned, I wish to keep in the background as\nfar as is humanly possible. That snapshot you got of a number\nof us here taken last summer was, in my estimation, a mistake.\nI will see that they do not get me in any more snapshots that\nmay be taken here because it defeats that intention of per-\nsonal effacement which is a sort of protective armour in my\nown case.”\nHess was deeply touched by Wilson’s letter, and replied that\nnothing in the world would give him greater satisfaction than\n“seeing you and sitting at your feet and learning from your\nlips the mysteries of Godliness.” But he didn’t think he or his\nwife could survive the journey to the Coast in their frail condi-\ntion. He sent Brother XII his love, and wished “God’s blessing\nupon your noble and self-sacrificing work.”\nBrother XII continued to solicit support for his Third\nParty. In the spring of 1928, he took another major step in ad-\nvancing his political work by forming the Protestant Protective\nLeague. The P.P.L. was designed to coordinate the activities\nof the various Protestant groups that were mobilizing for the\nupcoming American election. Advertisements in \nThe Chalice\nstated: “Romanism is organized. Protestantism is unorganized.\nThe P.P.L. exists for the purpose of organizing and combining\nall Protestant elements in the face of a common menace and\na common foe.” Brother XII intended to use the P.P.L. to\nbuild up the Third Party—and the Third Party to build up the\nP.P.L. He hoped that, together, the two organizations would\ngenerate the popular support he needed to ensure the nomi-\nnation of a Third Party candidate for President.\nBrother XII worked quickly to get the P.P.L. off the ground.\nHe arranged for an individual named C. J. Wright of Houston,\nTexas, to head the League in the United States, and for\nthe “news and views” of the P.P.L. to be printed in \nThe Pro-\nProtestant, a weekly newspaper published in Chicago. Closer to\nhome, he appointed a Vancouver department store executive\nnamed John Harrison to run the League in Canada. A bluff\n\n86 B R O T H E R X I I\nEnglishman and hail-fellow-well-met type, Harrison rented an\noffice in the Shelly Building in Vancouver and began drum-\nming up support for the League both locally and nationally.\nIn late March, eighteen-year-old Eric Davenport, a recent\ngraduate of the Pitman Business College, arrived at the P.P.L.\noffice to apply for a job as a secretary. The first question\nHarrison asked him was “Are you a Protestant?” Assured that\nhe was, the interview commenced. Harrison dictated a letter\nwhich Davenport took down in shorthand, then typed up on\nthe office’s new Corona typewriter. Pleased with his accuracy\nand speed, Harrison hired him on the spot and told him to\nstart work on the first of the month at a place called Cedar-\nby-the-Sea, outside Nanaimo. His salary would be fifty dollars\na month, with room and board. As Davenport was leaving,\nHarrison handed him a small printed card which stated that\nhe was a member in good standing of the Protestant Protective\nLeague.\nTwo days later, Davenport clutched anxiously at the dash-\nboard of Phillip Fisher’s pickup truck as it barrelled along\nthe twisting road towards Cedar. It was night—the ferry had\narrived late—and the glare of the headlights startled deer\nfeeding at the side of the road. Fisher talked incessantly as he\ndrove, explaining the work of the Aquarian Foundation to the\nnew employee.\n“He practically raved!” Davenport recalls. “He was talking\nall about Brother XII—and American politics—and all the\ngreat things that were going to happen. Then he turned to\nme with an odd look and said, ‘You don’t understand any of\nthis now—but one day you will.’”\nThe headquarters was in darkness when they arrived.\nCandles flickered in the windows of the houses, and in the\nmoonlight the trees cast gigantic shadows on the ground as\nDavenport stumbled out of the car and followed Fisher across\nthe clearing to Wilson’s house. In the eerie, candlelit interior,\nhe was introduced to Brother XII.\n“I was never so scared in all my life,” he recalls. “I didn’t\n\nEmpire of Evil 87\nknow what I was getting into—I thought he might be a mur-\nderer or something!”\nWilson quickly put the nervous youth at his ease, explaining\nthat there’d been a power failure at the Center—the Delco\ngenerator had broken down. Had he had anything to eat?\nhe asked. The next thing Davenport knew, he was over at the\nHobarts’ house, tucking into a big plate of bacon and eggs,\nwhile George and Louise fussed over him like a long-lost son.\nHe was soon fast asleep in a snug little bedroom upstairs in the\nCenter Building.\nIn the morning, Davenport reported for work in Wilson’s\noffice. His job was to take dictation and type up Brother XII’s\nletters. “He was writing to American senators, a police chief in\nChicago—people like that,” he recalls. “All ‘big shots,’ high\n‘muck-a-mucks’!”\nDavenport enjoyed working for Wilson, who was usually in\ngood spirits and had an engaging sense of humour. “He had\nthe sweetest laugh,” he recalls. “He’d throw his head back and\nchuckle—it was really catching!\n“One time, I had a terrible headache. When I told him I\ncouldn’t finish the letters, he said, ‘That’s all right, Eric; you\ngo upstairs to bed; I’ll type them.’ And he did—I could hear\nhim going like a bat out of hell!”\nIn warm weather, the two worked outdoors in front of the\nCenter Building. Wilson would sit cross-legged on the grass,\nguru-style, and dictate to his young secretary, while Daven-\nport would lie on his stomach with his shorthand notebook\npropped up in front of him:\n“I remember one letter took up thirteen pages—both\nsides— of my shorthand notebook. He’d go on and on—he’d\nelaborate tremendously. It was marvellous to hear him. That\nletter was my prize! I kept it for years!”\nMany of the letters Brother XII dictated concerned the\nP.P.L. He was trying to persuade other Protestant organiza-\ntions to join the League, so that the separate groups battling\nthe political program of the Roman Catholic Church could be\n\n88 B R O T H E R X I I\ncombined into one united, effective whole. He didn’t intend\nfor the P.P.L. to be only “one more berry on the bush,” as he\nput it. He reminded his various correspondents of the maxim,\n“In unity is strength.”\nBrother XII was also laying in large quantities of supplies at\nthe headquarters—flour, sugar, salt, matches, needles, and a\nvariety of building materials.\n“I spent all day helping him store sugar in the attic of his\nhouse,” recalls Davenport. “We took turns throwing ten-\npound sacks of sugar up to each other. He even had big bolts\nof blue cloth stored in the Center Building—you could’ve\nmade dozens of suits from them. He was stockpiling it all for\nArmageddon!”\nThe spring of 1928 also saw a group of new arrivals take up\npermanent residence at the headquarters. In April, Maurice\nand Alice Von Platen drove up from Pasadena, hauling a\ntrailer loaded with furniture. Brother XII greeted the distin-\nguished-looking retired businessman and his elegant wife as\nthey pulled up in front of the Center Building, and showed\nthem to the new home that Von Platen had arranged to have\nbuilt for them. It was a spacious two bedroom house with a\nstone fireplace, large sundeck, and twin garages. The Von\nPlatens settled into their new home, delighted to be at the\nCenter, since they’d dreamed for many years of living in a spir-\nitual community.\nThe Von Platens were soon joined by their friends, the\nSquiers. Ethel Squier and Alice von Platen had been lifelong\ncompanions—they’d attended the same girls’ school in Albany,\nNew York—and had been neighbours in Pasadena, where\nEthel and her daughter, Lucita, ran a successful weaving busi-\nness. Von Platen had also built a fine house for the Squiers,\ncomplete with a weaving studio, since they planned for their\nwork to provide a source of income for the colony.\nAnother friend of the Von Platens’ arrived, an astrologer\nnamed Robert DeLuce. A lanky, slow-speaking former mining\n\nEmpire of Evil 89\nengineer from the Midwest, DeLuce had taught astrology at\nFirst Temple and College of Astrology in Los Angeles. He’d\ntried to start a colony similar to the Aquarian Foundation\nseveral years earlier in Pasadena without success. He was inter-\nested in using the occult sciences to extend the human lifespan,\nand his article on this topic, “Physical Regeneration,” had ap-\npeared in \nThe Chalice under the name “Lux.” DeLuce and his\nfamily moved into the house which Von Platen had built for\nthem. Brother XII was pleased to have a man of DeLuce’s rep-\nutation at the Center and made him a Governor of the Society,\nfilling the vacancy created by Comfort’s resignation.\nArriving at about the same time as DeLuce was Coulson\nTurnbull, who drove up from Santa Cruz with his wife, Cecilia.\nIt was a honeymoon and the start of a new life for the couple,\nsince Turnbull’s first wife had recently died after a long ill-\nness. Already considered one of the leading astrologers in\nthe country, Turnbull became a regular contributor to The\nChalice\n. Brother XII informed the members: “There are few\nmen in America with insight so keen and knowledge so com-\nprehensive as that possessed by Dr. Turnbull.”\nAnother important addition to the community was a former\nsecret service agent with the United States Government who\nhad also been a detective with the William S. Burns Agency\nand an accountant for the U. S. Treasury Department. Robert\nEngland arrived at the colony from Oceano, California,\npacking a pair of Colt 32s, and amazed everyone with a dem-\nonstration of his lightning-fast draw from a shoulder holster.\nDespite his adventurous background, England was an intro-\nspective man whose life had been marked by the tragic death\nof his wife and daughter several years earlier. In Frances\nLucas’s autograph book, he wrote: “May life’s purpose prove\nitself to you without the harshness and the sting I felt for many\nyears. The motive will bring the counterpart of itself into every\naspect of life. May your motive be above the worldly concerns\nso common.” England soon made himself indispensable to\nBrother XII, who appointed him Secretary-Treasurer and\n\n90 B R O T H E R X I I\nlater a Governor of the Foundation.\nAnd lastly, one of the most enthusiastic members of the\nFoundation arrived after a “Keystone Cops” chase up the coast\nfrom Los Angeles. James Janney Lippincott, a distant relative\nof the publishing family, was a draftsman whose passion for\nastrology—to the complete neglect of his domestic respon-\nsibilities—had his wife Louise at her wits’ end. Lippincott\ndescribed himself to Brother XII as “a regular ‘blood-hound’\nfor Truth,” and wrote that he wished to make “an ORDERED\nand LOVING” separation from his wife, so he could devote\nhimself completely to the Work. When he finally fled to British\nColumbia, Louise followed in hot pursuit, trying to have him\ncommitted, so that she could obtain a financial settlement\nfrom him.\n“He joked about it,” Eric Davenport recalls. “Whenever she\ncaught up to him, she’d go to the police, claim he was crazy,\nand have him thrown in jail. In Seattle, he was given this pair\nof denim coveralls to wear. He was six feet six, and they were\nso short, the sleeves only came up to his elbows. They wouldn’t\nlet him shave. ‘Just imagine what I looked like when I went\nbefore the judge!’ he said. ‘You see, I \nlooked crazy!’”\nLippincott took refuge at the Center, where he did astro-\nlogical charts for Brother XII and helped with The Chalice. His\nwife returned to Los Angeles after her claim for support was\nthrown out of the British Columbia courts on a technicality.\nOnce they were settled at the headquarters, the new arrivals\nworked hard to make the colony a thriving success. Maurice\nVon Platen spoke for them all when he wrote to Oliver Hess:\n“I’m sorry your advanced years do not make a trip here pos-\nsible, since only in person can you know the thrill of personal\ncontact with the life here.”\nBrother XII now purchased four hundred acres on nearby\nValdes Island. He planned to build a new settlement here in\nthe tradition of the \nashram, the Hindu equivalent of the mon-\nastery. It would be a separate community for selected disciples,\n\nEmpire of Evil 91\ndistinct from the colony headquarters at Cedar. The land was\npark-like, with grassy open spaces and great groves of cedar,\nmaple, and madrona. The Indian lands to the south would\ngive him seclusion and the freedom from outside interference\nthat he desired. He planned to build a wharf, a freight shed,\na blacksmith’s shop, and a small schoolhouse; otherwise, he\nwould keep the property as natural as possible. He told Hess\nhe’d start a herd of Angora goats for their wool and plant\nflax for linen. The soil was rich and there was an inexhaust-\nible supply of fish along the coast. There was also excellent\nwater on the property: “I know of one natural spring where\nthe water is ice-cold even on the hottest days.” Brother XII\nplanned to get the settlement started in the next few months:\n“This Center is intended to be an actual place of refuge, where\nmay come some of our people as are prepared to actually live\nthe true Aquarian life; it goes without saying that they will be\nvery carefully selected.”\nThe careful selection of candidates for the Work was a\ngrowing concern of Brother XII’s. He believed that every\neffort by the White Lodge for the helping of humanity was\nopposed by the forces of evil, and that “enemy agents” would\ninevitably try to infiltrate the Aquarian Foundation groups\nand nullify their work. For this reason, he insisted that every\nmember take an oath of allegiance called “The Obligation,”\nswearing not to create dissension within the group or to hide,\nunder the guise of a seeming loyalty, secret doubt or disloyalty\nto the Work. Anyone who refused to take “The Obligation”\nwas expelled from the Foundation.\nThe members of the Aquarian Foundation who met weekly\nacross the United States and Canada practised a form of group\nmeditation. For twenty minutes each meeting, they sat in a\ncircle with their eyes closed, their minds raised to contact the\nhigher planes. They believed that through a kind of “spiritual\nalchemy” their Higher Selves would blend together, the vibra-\ntion of the group would be raised, and each member would\nbe able to obtain direct enlightenment. It was thought that\n\n92 B R O T H E R X I I\nan individual working with a group could attain higher con-\nsciousness much more easily and rapidly than an individual\nworking alone.\nThis work of the groups was threatened, however, by the\nso-called “Brothers of the Shadow,” Black Masters who were\ntrying to invade the groups from the astral plane. In one\nof his monthly Instructions, Brother XII identified a well-\nknown Rosicrucian teacher in California as one of these Black\nAdepts. He described the tall, Mephistophelian figure to the\nmembers, warning them not to be deceived by the impressive\nhelmet, robes, and purplish and yellow light that illumi-\nnated this praying “Master”: “Stripped of its false beauty of\ncolouring, the likeness of THE BEAST is found beneath. THE\nREAL BROTHERS OF LIGHT, OF THE GREAT WHITE\nBROTHERHOOD, WEAR NO HELMET TO PRODUCE\nTHE STAR.”\nShould this figure be seen psychically by any member of\nthe group during meditation, it was to be challenged at once\nin the name of the Great White Lodge. If it refused to make\nthe sign of the Cross and declare its allegiance to the White\nBrotherhood, it was to be disintegrated:\nInhale a deep breath, at the same time mentally asking\nfor and drawing down the force of the White Lodge\ninto yourself. Then extend the right arm and point the\nfinger at the suspected figure. Now exhale, and \nwith all\nthe mental concentration possible\n, say: ‘I repel you, I resist\nyou; by the power of the White Brotherhood, I disinte-\ngrate and drive asunder your body of evil—GO!’ Make\nthe sign of the Cross. When sending out the disintegrating\npower, visualize it as issuing from the center between\nyour eyebrows and following the course of the extended\narm and finger. SHOOT IT INTO THE SUSPECTED\nFIGURE WITH ALL THE FORCE YOU CAN MUSTER!\nBrother XII urged the members to practise drawing down\n\nEmpire of Evil 93\nthe force of the White Lodge daily, not only so they could dis-\nintegrate malevolent astral entities, but also so they could send\nthe energy out on missions of help and healing: “Remember\nthat these are real and potent POWERS, and that limitation is\nonly in the instrument, for the power itself is unlimited.”\nA real-life attack on the Work was made at this time by\nsomeone Brother XII was quick to accuse of being an agent\nof the “dark forces”—none other than Albert E. S. Smythe,\nthe General Secretary of the Theosophical Society in Canada.\nSmythe had been suspicious of Wilson’s motives from the\nbeginning, and now his skepticism had turned into open\nhostility. In an editorial in \nThe Canadian Theosophist, “Blind\nLeaders of the Blind,” he denounced Brother XII as a char-\nlatan and ridiculed his claims to be a member of the Great\nWhite Lodge. He called Aquarian Foundation members\n“boobs,” “dupes,” and “cuckoos,” and claimed that Brother\nXII was trying to break up the Theosophical Society in Canada\nso that he could draw disaffected members into his own or-\nganization. He also condemned Brother XII’s political views\nand his “diabolical” policy of promoting religious intolerance\nby setting Protestants against Catholics. He accused Brother\nXII of being an imposter, one of the many occult frauds who\npreyed on the weak and ignorant, “wolves in sheep’s clothing,\nwho devour widows’ houses and batten on the possessions of\nthe simple-minded.”\nBrother XII was enraged by Smythe’s attack. He published\na refutation of it in The Chalice, answering Smythe’s charges\npoint by point. He accused Smythe himself of being respon-\nsible for breaking up the Theosophical Society, and quoted\nletters from former executives who claimed that Smythe’s\ndictatorial conduct had driven them to resign. The most re-\nvealing feature of Brother XII’s reply was the invective he\nheaped upon the editor of The Canadian Theosophist:\nThis hate-inspired misanthrope. . . this Jesuitical prevari-\ncator. . . this cowardly traducer. . . He is a pusillanimous\n\n94 B R O T H E R X I I\nmouther of empty words. . . a typical Mr. Facing-both-ways\n. . . so far as any official recognition is concerned, this man\nwill die, choked by the lies he utters. . . the man is already\ndead to truth, to honour, and to Brotherhood. . . Those who\nhave vision know that the lower astral worlds already yawn\nfor him. . . \nWhat can be the mental attitude of such a monster\nof hatred and slander? . . the loathsome maggots which infest\nhis brain. . . this venom-infected creature. . . this creature of\npoisoned fangs. . . Albert E. S. Smythe has made the Theo-\nsophical Society in Canada a house of lies. . .\nBrother XII’s vicious attack upon Smythe’s character ap-\npalled everyone who read it. Henry N. Stokes, an astute\nobserver of contemporary Theosophical issues and the editor\nof \nThe Oriental & Esoteric Library Critic, published in Wash-\nington, D. C., commented on Brother XII’s article in his\neditorial, “The Brother XII Bursts Into Billingsgate.”\n“Is this the sort of language which is to be handed out to\nthe disciples?” Stokes asked. “Is returning evil for evil one of\nthe principles of that Lodge which is supposed to include the\nBuddha and the Christ? If so, may the gods spare us from such\na Lodge and from such a Messenger. It is too much to look for\nperfection in a leader, but one has the right to expect some-\nthing more than an exhibit of bar-room language in lieu of an\nargument.”\nStokes concluded that either Brother XII’s claim to com-\nmunion with the White Lodge was a delusion—he would not\ngo so far as to say a conscious fraud—or that the members of\nthat Lodge had been “singularly unfortunate” in their choice\nof Messenger.\nr r r\nThe 1928 American presidential election was now less than\nsix months away. On June 12 in Kansas City, and on June 26\nin Houston, the Republicans and the Democrats, respectively,\n\nEmpire of Evil 95\nwere holding their conventions to nominate their candidates\nfor president and vice president of the United States. Two\nweeks before the Houston convention, Brother XII wrote to\nHess:\n“I have a pretty big finger in the Houston pie, and I may\ntell you that the results of the Democratic Convention will be\nboth unexpected and startling. Quite likely, Al Smith will get\nthe nomination, and that will suit our plans perfectly.”\nHis prediction proved correct. Smith was easily nominated\non the first ballot when the last-ditch “Stop Smith” drive failed\nto materialize. And in Kansas City, Herbert Hoover, promising\nfour more years of Republican prosperity, was nominated by\nacclamation on the first ballot.\nAs the campaign moved into high gear, Brother XII stepped\nup his efforts to make the Protestant Protective League and\nthe Third Party a major political force. In Washington, D. C.,\nhis organizers worked feverishly to enlist support for the Third\nParty. At the same time, thousands of copies of Brother XII’s\narticles from The Chalice were reprinted and distributed across\nthe United States. They were also published as a book, The End\nof the Days\n. Its title was taken from the last verse of the Book of\nDaniel: “But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest,\nand stand in thy lot at the end of the days.” In the foreword,\nCoulson Turnbull called the articles “history-making” and de-\npicted Brother XII as the agent of destiny, leading humanity\nforward into a new era of truth and enlightenment.\nBrother XII now sent a letter to U.S. senators and members\nof the House of Representatives, appealing for their support.\nThe letter was published in \nThe Chalice as “An Open Letter to\nCertain Senators, Representatives, and Leaders in the United\nStates of America,” and was described in advertisements as\n“the most important and vital document issued in the United\nStates since the Declaration of Independence.”\nBrother XII warned in the letter that the United States was\nfacing one of the greatest crises in its history—the threat of\nanother civil war. He predicted that if a Roman Catholic were\n\n96 B R O T H E R X I I\nelected president, the people of the United States would rise\nup in arms to resist religious domination. If, on the other\nhand, the Roman Catholic hierarchy did \nnot win to power\nelectorally, civil war was still inevitable, since Catholics—led\nby the Knights of Columbus—would mercilessly slaughter mil-\nlions of Protestants in order to gain supreme control. “All the\npreparations for this holocaust are made,” he declared, \n“and\nthe date is set.” \nThe existing government would be powerless to\nprevent the slaughter and would be swept away “in a tempest\nof blood and destruction.”\nThis disaster could only be averted if the congressional\nleaders gave their immediate support to the formation of a\nThird Party.\nThe instrument that could secure the formation of the Third\nParty and guarantee the safety of the nation already existed,\nBrother XII announced. It was politically untainted, uncom-\npromised by any stigma, and ready to thoroughly purge the\nrotting evils from national life:\nThe Instrument prepared for your use is both keen and\nclean; it is new-born, a child of Power and of the Cleansing\nFire, an offspring of that new Spirit whose winds already\nsweep across the world. . . The name of this Instrument\nwhich shall yet prevail in the Cause of Righteousness is:\nTHE PROTESTANT PROTECTIVE LEAGUE.\nWill you use it or refuse it? But be sure of one thing;\nwhatever may be your choice—\nthe people will use it.\nBrother XII urged the senators to take instant and deci-\nsive action, since very little time remained to accomplish the\nwork:\nBetween this date and the month of October 1928, the\nLeague must have its lodges in every State, city, town and\nhamlet in the Union. We must number these lodges by thou-\nsands, and the total membership by millions. That task may\n\nEmpire of Evil 97\nsound formidable to you, yet it can and shall be done; its\nsuccess is already assured by the publication of these words.\nYou have only to combine in cooperative action and \nto\ncirculate this communication by the million; that is your part—\nthe nation will do the rest.\nLet each Senator or Representative be allotted one State,\nso that all are covered. Let one newspaper publish this\nappeal in every State. Let the Senator or Representative ap-\npoint efficient lieutenants in the State allotted to him, and\nlet them create an efficient field-organization. Do this now,\nand the work will be accomplished in sixty days.\nBrother XII was certain that the response to his letter would\nbe overwhelming—great enough to meet all the preliminary\nfinancial needs of both the League and the Third Party. He\npredicted that the League would make the Third Party effec-\ntive and then sweep it forward into power with an irresistible\nmajority—a majority unequalled in the political history of the\nnation.\nIt was a dramatic appeal; how effective it would be re-\nmained to be seen. The events of the next few months would\ndetermine whether or not Brother XII’s political vision would\nbecome a reality.\nr r r\nOn July 5, the members of the Aquarian Foundation at\nCedar gathered together in the auditorium of the Center\nBuilding. One year ago on the occasion of the Foundation’s\nfirst annual General Meeting, Brother XII had talked of the\nGreat White Lodge and the powerful spiritual forces that lay\nbehind the Work. Today, his address was concerned with more\nimmediate and practical concerns—the political situation in\nthe United States.\nBrother XII told the assembled members and Governors\nthat the present situation in the United States was actu-\n\n98 B R O T H E R X I I\nally much worse than he had stated publicly. The nation\nwas threatened not only by civil war, but by an even more\nhorrible threat—an uprising of twenty-odd million Negroes\nin the South, armed and led by the Communists. Behind this\n“devil’s work” were the Jews: “The Jewish world-dictatorship\nis about to be set up, and the head—the Jewish Messiah—is a\nmember of the Rothschild family long resident in Paris.”\nMoving from racism to religious paranoia, Brother XII then\ndiscussed the work of the Protestant Protective League and\nthe Third Party. He claimed that many prominent leaders\nwere now committed to the Third Party. The nomination of\nSmith had clinched the issue, since they’d made their support\nconditional upon his selection by the Democrats. Hoover’s\nnomination by the Republicans meant further support.\nPublicity was now their most powerful weapon—their hope of\nsuccess lay in rousing the nation:\n“I purpose within the next sixty days to have the League\nknown and discussed in every home in the United States, to\nhave lodges in every town and state in the Union. . . If this\nLeague goes as I think it will go; if the people respond as I\nthink they \nwill respond, then in a few months we will be in con-\ntrol of the most powerful single political factor in the country.\nThe success or non-success of any political party will depend\nlargely upon the support of this League, and the League will\nbe non-partisan. Behind the National Council of the League\nstands the Supreme Council, and the bidding of the Supreme\nCouncil will be the will of the Regent of the Lodge.”\nBrother XII then spoke of his plans to attend the Third\nParty Convention in Chicago:\nIn a few days, I expect to go down into the arena; I\nexpect to go to a certain city in the Middle-West and there\nto arrange for the Conference of the THIRD PARTY to\nbe held. I expect to have some part in the selection of the\nCommittee—of the men in whose hands the fate of the\nConvention will lie, and \nI expect to select, and will select, the\n\nEmpire of Evil 99\nman who is to be the next president of the United States, and also\nthe next vice president. That is where I need the whip, and\nthat is the occasion upon which I will use it. Either these\nmen shall do the will of the Lodge or I will loose plagues\nand desolations upon them beyond all telling. It is better\nthat they should suffer than that infinitely worse horrors\nengulf the nation as a whole.\nBrother XII concluded by giving a brief review of what had\nbeen accomplished in the past six months:\nIn November 1927, we had nothing. Politically and every\nother way, we were weaponless and defenceless—we did not\neven have any means of publicity—and that is why I started\nThe Chalice. We had to forge our own weapons; we had to\nwork with unwilling, or indifferent, or even hostile instru-\nments, and at every stage, we have lacked money and any\nadequate financial support.\nIn November 1927, I had to sit into a big game—the big-\ngest game in the world today. I had a poor hand, almost no\nhand at all, so I went to Washington to draw cards. I drew\nthree aces, though I will confess to you that I was dishonest\nenough to manufacture them myself. These were—(1) a\ncrimp on the politicians; (2) the Third Party; and (3) the\nLeague. I went to Washington to draw them; now I will\nshortly go to a certain city in the Middle-West to play them.\nIf these are not enough, then I have two others—I have\ngot five aces in this game and that is a pretty dangerous\nhand to hold, as many people have found to their cost. I\nhope I may not have to show the fifth because if that has\nto be played, there will be very little left of either the game\nor the players—the FIFTH ACE is a Joker; it is called, “The\nNinety percent.”\nGentlemen, I have ended on a note which is light because\nwe always fight best if we go into the fight with a laugh. But\nour task is no light one, and as I have told you so often\n\n100 B R O T H E R X I I\nbefore, we can accomplish it only if we are utterly selfless,\nutterly impersonal, utterly true. I have told you much, but I\ncannot tell you all. The eyes which look into the future and\nsee the whole of it must be incapable of tears; the vision\nmust be clear, undimmed by sentiment of any kind, even as\nthe decisions must be final and inflexible. Therefore, I look\nto you for your trust, your support, and for a loyalty which\nmay not be shaken. Give me these, and we shall win.\nThe speech was over. Brother XII stood alone, the\nspiritual warrior girding his loins for the battle. He was certain\nthe Masters would lead him to victory.\n\nMadame Helena Petrovna\nBlavatsky, author of The Secret\nDoctrine \nand founder of\nthe Theosophical Society.\nBrother XII believed his\nmission was to carry forward\nher work into the year 2000.\n(Bettmann Archives)\nMembership application from\nThe Aquarian Foundation\nbooklet, published by\nSun Publishing Company,\nAkron, Ohio,\nApril 18, 1927.\n\nOn this wooded shoreline at Cedar-by-the-Sea, Brother XII set up his\nspiritual community, declaring that his work was “the first Trumpet-blast\nof the New Age.” Round Island is directly offshore.

Porters hurried baggage down the platform\nand the last stragglers clambered aboard. At 8:15 A.M., the\npowerful Baldwin locomotive sent a plume of steam curling\ninto the air. As the sunlight glinted off the gold Roman lettering\non the sides of its Pullman coaches, the Oriental Limited\nrolled slowly out of the station. Picking up speed, it bumped\nthrough the switches and curved slowly east, beginning the\nsixty-eight hour, 2,238-mile journey to Chicago.\nInside the swaying coaches, a slender figure in a grey\nsuit moved down the center aisle. Elsewhere on the train, a\nstriking, dark-haired woman named Myrtle Wells Baumgartner\nsat alone. The wife of a physician in Clifton Springs, New\nYork, Myrtle was returning from a trip to the West Coast. Her\nhusband, Dr. Edwin A. Baumgartner, had injured himself\n\n102 B R O T H E R X I I\nseveral years earlier playing football. A vigorous, athletic man,\nhis bitterness at becoming an invalid had destroyed their mar-\nriage. Myrtle had nursed him faithfully, but the relationship\nhad become an intolerable burden. She desperately yearned\nfor a new sense of meaning in her life.\nThe Oriental Limited skirted the shores of Puget Sound\nas Edward Arthur Wilson and Myrtle Baumgartner fell into\nconversation. She was soon telling him about herself and the\ndetails of her unhappy marriage. As the train wound through\nthe snowy passes of the Rocky Mountains, Myrtle talked to\nher new companion about her aspirations and her spiritual\nsearch. Wilson, in turn, told her of his years of solitude and\nstruggle, and of his own spiritual awakening. He spoke of his\ncontact with the Masters and his work as Brother XII. Time\npassed and the rapport between them grew. The Oriental\nLimited left the Cascades behind and descended into the\nhigh plains of Montana. In the great vault of the sky above,\nthe stars glittered. The stillness of the night seemed to make\ntheir choice for them. As the train moved out across the vast\nprairie, they retired to Wilson’s Pullman sleeper. The plaintive\nsound of the whistle drifted back to the hushed compartment\nas the two explored the mystical bond that had brought them\ntogether again in the flesh.\nIt was no doubt one of the strangest seductions in history.\nDuring the two days and three nights of the journey, the\ncouple renewed a love affair which Wilson claimed had origi-\nnated thousands of years earlier in ancient Egypt. A romance\nwhich had been played out in the court of the Pharaoh and\ncelebrated in the shrines of magnificent temples blossomed\nagain in twentieth-century North America. For, in the course\nof the trip, Edward Arthur Wilson and Myrtle Baumgartner\ndiscovered they were soul mates, and learned that they shared\na destiny of monumental importance. It is not recorded\nwhere on this journey their mystical ecstasy occurred, but\nsomewhere beneath the blazing constellations the two soul\nmates took the “Sixth Initiation.” During this powerful occult\n\nOsiris and Isis 103\nceremony, it was revealed to them that they were the reincar-\nnations of Egyptian divinities: Wilson was the god Osiris, and\nMyrtle Baumgartner was the goddess Isis. It was also revealed\nthat a son would be born to them who would be the reincar-\nnation of the Egyptian god Horus. This child would become a\nWorld Teacher in 1975 and lead humanity into a new spiritual\nage that would usher in the Millennium.\nDid Myrtle Baumgartner really believe that she and Wilson\nwere the reincarnations of Osiris and Isis? Was she an initiate,\nas he later claimed? Or was she merely a victim of Brother\nXII’s charisma and of her own desire for an exalted destiny?\nThe answer will probably never be known. In any event, Myrtle\ndid not question the truth of these awesome revelations or\nbalk at their implications. She enthusiastically embraced her\nrole as mother of the next World Teacher, and gave herself\nutterly to Brother XII.\nThe blues and golds of the morning light streamed into\nthe compartment as the Oriental Limited sped towards the\ntwin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The fields and farms\nflashed past. Through the dairy country of Wisconsin the train\nfled, following the Mississippi River south towards Chicago.\nInto the outskirts of the city it swept, past warehouses, facto-\nries, and stockyards, finally plunging into the dark cavern of\nUnion Station. The journey had ended, but the romance of\nthe ages had been consummated—Myrtle Wells Baumgartner\nhad conceived the next saviour of the world.\nr r r\nBrother XII arrived in Chicago in the middle of a heat wave.\nThe grass had turned brown in the parks along Lakeshore\nDrive and the great canyons of the downtown core were like\novens. Hundreds had collapsed from heatstroke and there\nhad been ten deaths in a single week. Into this sweltering\ncrucible poured the delegates from three American political\nminority groups, each of which was holding its own conven-\n\n104 B R O T H E R X I I\ntion in Chicago to nominate candidates for president and vice\npresident of the United States.\nOn July 10, the 152 delegates of the Prohibition Party\nopened their convention at the LaSalle Hotel. The ornate\nballroom was ringed by a battery of fans to keep the sweating\ndelegates cool as they called for a more rigorous enforce-\nment of Prohibition. Herbert Hoover was regarded as being\ntoo weak on the issue, while Alfred Smith was anathema—he\nwanted to repeal Prohibition altogether.\nNearby in the more modest Stevens Hotel, the delegates of\nthe Farmer-Labor Party opened their convention. A smaller\ngroup, they mopped their brows and sipped ice water from\nbig tumblers as they discussed labour issues and the need for\nfarm relief. They regarded both Hoover and Smith as unsym-\npathetic to their concerns.\nThe third group meeting in Chicago was something of a\npolitical mystery. The Jefferson-Lincoln League, composed\nlargely of dry Democrats from Washington, D. C., had dele-\ngates in each of the other two conventions. It wanted to unite\nthe Prohibition Party and the Farmer-Labor Party into a Third\nParty coalition. Brother XII intended to use the Jefferson-\nLincoln League as the vehicle for his own political agenda.\nBrother XII moved between the two hotels, lobbying del-\negates. He repeatedly stressed that there was only one issue\nin the coming election—not Prohibition, not farm or labour\nconcerns, but religion. If Hoover were elected president, eco-\nnomic chaos would sweep the nation. If Smith were elected,\nthe United States would be plunged into civil war. The fate of\nAmerica was at stake, he warned. And there was only one man\nwho could lead a Third Party coalition to victory—Senator\nJames Thomas Heflin.\nThe Jefferson-Lincoln League scored an early success when\nthe Prohibition and Farmer-Labor parties agreed to strike a\nspecial committee to discuss a possible Third Party merger.\nDelegates from the three groups retired to work out the de-\ntails of the coalition.\n\nOsiris and Isis 105\nIn the LaSalle Hotel, the religious issue erupted in the\nProhibition Party convention when a delegate from Okla-\nhoma vigorously attacked the Roman Catholic Church.\n“We have to beat the Roman Catholic hierarchy that has\nbeen responsible for the assassination of our presidents and\nthe slaying of five million Protestants!” he cried. “Al Smith\nmust be defeated, even if there’s bloodshed— even at the cost\nof our lives!”\nThe hall was in an uproar. Many delegates echoed their\nagreement, while others tried to shout the speaker down,\ncalling him a bigot.\n“\nSenator Heflin is my candidate!” he shouted as the other del-\negates clamoured to speak.\nWas this Brother XII’s moment of opportunity? In the sea\nof frantic faces and waving arms, as scores of delegates tried\nto make their voices heard above the pandemonium, did he\nstruggle forward to speak? If he could have spoken, could\nhe have swayed the convention with his powers of rhetoric,\nuniting the delegates around the issue of religion and win-\nning their support for Heflin and the cause of a Third Party?\nHistory does not record him doing so. If he indeed tried\nto speak, it was too late. The moment was lost. The chairman\ncalled the convention to order and the commotion gradually\nsubsided. The opportunity did not repeat itself as the religious\nissue was not raised again.\nThat evening the members of the Third Party committee\ntalked late into the night, but they were unable to reconcile\ntheir differences. The next morning the effort at unification\nwas abandoned. And with it disappeared Brother XII’s hopes\nfor a Third Party coalition.\nThe following day, the delegates seemed to lose heart.\nAttendance at the two conventions dwindled. In the LaSalle\nHotel, less than fifty delegates of the Prohibition Party re-\nmained to cast their ballots as the fans whirred inside the\nnearly empty hall. In the Stevens Hotel, even fewer Farmer-\nLabor delegates lingered to nominate their party’s candidate\n\n106 B R O T H E R X I I\nfor president. After the voting, a forlorn group passed the hat,\ncollecting less than one hundred dollars to pay expenses. It\nwas a humiliating finale.\nReporting the fiasco, \nTime magazine observed that the dele-\ngates had accomplished “just about as little as several hundred\nadult citizens could possibly have accomplished had they set\nout purposefully to be futile for several days.”\nThe outcome of the conventions in Chicago was surely dis-\nappointing to Brother XII. But for him, the debacle was made\nworse by the fact that his Protestant Protective League was at-\ntracting much less support than he’d hoped. He must also\nhave been discouraged by the response to his “Open Letter.”\nA number of influential senators had already declared that\nit was too late to put the political machinery in place to field\na third-party ticket. It was now obvious that Brother XII’s\nprogram would never be realized. His grandiose dreams of\npolitical power had proved to be a delusion.\nBrother XII’s political work was in disarray, but he con-\ntinued to press forward with his other plans. Before returning\nto the headquarters in British Columbia, he arranged to meet\nthe wealthiest member of the Aquarian Foundation, a promi-\nnent socialite from Asheville, North Carolina, named Mary\nWortham Thomas Connally.\n“Lady Mary,” as she was known to her friends, was the scion\nof one of the most illustrious families in the American South.\nShe lived in a fifty-room colonial mansion called Fernihurst,\nlocated in the exclusive Biltmore Forest district of Asheville.\nThe house overlooked the French Broad River and had a\nmagnificent view of the Blue Ridge Mountains and Mt. Pisgah.\nMary’s ancestors had arrived in America in 1608, twelve years\nbefore the \nMayflower, and had sat in the House of Burgesses,\nthe first governing body in America. Mary’s father, Colonel\nJohn Kerr Connally, was a Civil War hero and a prominent\nlawyer in Richmond, Virginia. After narrowly escaping death\nwhen the floor in the Capitol collapsed, he renounced law\n\nOsiris and Isis 107\nand entered the ministry, becoming an eloquent preacher of\nthe Gospel. Colonel Connally was rigid in his beliefs and dis-\napproved of drinking and social gaiety. His socialite wife, Alice\nColeman Thomas, daughter of an English tobacco merchant,\nloved to entertain. She often held parties at Fernihurst that\nlasted for several days and were attended by as many as five-\nhundred guests, including her friends the Vanderbilts. On\nthese occasions the Colonel would retreat to the small house\nbehind the mansion or ride out to his property in the Black\nMountains to meditate. Mary was influenced by the twin but\ncontradictory values of her parents: her mother’s love of so-\nciety and self-indulgence, and her father’s self-denial and\nreligious discipline.\nThe eldest of three daughters, Mary was raised at Fernihurst\nin a world of wealth and privilege. Each of the girls had her\nown servants, even a personal maid to help her dress and un-\ndress. Mary travelled widely as a girl, often visiting her uncle,\nthe American ambassador to the court of Spain at Madrid. An\nexcellent horsewoman, she won many trophies at horse shows.\nMarried twice—both times to wealthy and prominent men—\nand twice divorced, Mary’s greatest loss in life came with the\ndeath of her only son, Tench Francis Coxe. Only twenty-nine\nyears of age, with a young wife and twin daughters, he died of\npneumonia in 1923.\nMary continued to travel and to read extensively. She was\nsixty years old when she discovered Brother XII’s writings. “I\nwas interested in world conditions,” she later recalled. “I had\nstudied religions and philosophies and systems of economy\nand financial conditions everywhere, and nothing seemed to\nbe very satisfactory, and quite by accident, in November 1927,\nwhen I was in the West, I was given a book called Foundation\nLetters and Teachings\n, and I was absolutely amazed at what it\ncontained.”\nThe teachings in the book coincided with Mary’s own\nideas about how society could be changed. She immediately\njoined the Aquarian Foundation and studied the monthly\n\n108 B R O T H E R X I I\nInstructions and other literature she received. These intensi-\nfied her desire to become involved in the Work. In June 1928,\nshe sent a cheque for two thousand dollars to the headquar-\nters. She received a personal reply from Brother XII, thanking\nher for her donation. Mary wrote back, requesting a meeting\nwith him.\nIn August 1928, Mary was staying in Washington, D. C.,\nwhere she kept an apartment, when she received a telegram\nfrom Coulson Turnbull advising her that Brother XII was in\nthe East on business. Could she meet him in Toronto on the\nfourteenth of August? Mary quickly replied that she could, and\nthe meeting was arranged that would change her life forever.\nr r r\nIn the elegant lobby of the King Edward Hotel in Toronto,\nMary Connally waited expectantly for Brother XII. An aristo-\ncratic woman with flaxen hair, she wore a special dress for the\noccasion—dark blue, with a pattern of half-moons. Wilson ar-\nrived, impeccable in a tweed suit and soft felt hat, and greeted\nMary. He was intrigued by her dress and remarked that she\nmust have worn it because the moon was entering the first\nquarter the next day. Mary thought him charming.\nThe two discussed Brother XII’s work, perhaps over a lei-\nsurely meal in the hotel dining room. Mary told him of her\namazement upon reading \nFoundation Letters and Teachings for\nthe first time. “Why, at the risk of being thought presumptuous,”\nshe declared, “I might have written that book myself!” Wilson\noutlined to Mary his plans for a new settlement on Valdes\nIsland. He described the school he wanted to build there, and\nsaid that food, clothing, and shelter would be provided free\nof charge to the children of Foundation members. He spoke\nof how traditional education interfered with the natural un-\nfolding of innate character, smothering a child’s spiritual\nperceptions. Mary told him about her own grandchildren and\nhow difficult it was to raise children in the jazz atmosphere of\n\nOsiris and Isis 109\nmodern times. She was impressed by Brother XII’s emphasis\non the importance of children to the Work.\n“I was convinced that this was the Work which I was going to\ndo in the world,” she later recalled. “He had it in a nutshell, so\nto speak. It was as if different architects had offered you a plan\nfor a great world-building or temple. I accepted his drawings,\nwhich were outlined in \nFoundation Letters and Teachings and\nthe letters which followed. They were the specifications and\nthe blueprints. I then realized that he was to be the contractor\nas well as the architect, and that he, and he alone, could carry\nout those plans.”\nMary explained that she wanted to make a further contri-\nbution of twenty-three thousand dollars to the cause, bringing\nher total donation to twenty-five thousand dollars. Brother\nXII expressed his profound gratitude and briefly discussed\nwith her the terms of her donation. The meeting lasted a little\nover three hours. At the end of it, as they were saying goodbye,\nhe thanked Mary again and told her that she had a “special\nplace” in the Work.\nMary returned to Washington, D. C., convinced she’d found\nher life’s purpose. She made out a cheque for twenty-three\nthousand dollars and mailed it to Brother XII at the Aquarian\nFoundation headquarters at Cedar.\nr r r\nBrother XII returned to Cedar at the end of August, ac-\ncompanied by Myrtle Baumgartner. The two arrived late at\nnight, while the members of the Foundation were asleep. In\nhis bedroom upstairs in the Center Building, Eric Davenport\nwas awakened by the sound of voices.\n“I recognized Wilson’s voice, but not the woman’s,” he re-\ncalls. “I never saw her. The next morning, she was gone. He\nhustled her over to Valdes Island to give birth to the next\nChrist.”\nBrother XII installed Myrtle in a two-room log cabin at\n\n110 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe top of a ridge on the east side of Valdes. The cabin had a\nkitchen and bedroom and was sparsely furnished with a cast-\niron stove, table and chairs and a large double bed. Myrtle\nremained there in seclusion, while Brother XII returned\nto Cedar to resume control of the daily operations of the\nFoundation.\nBrother XII kept Myrtle’s presence at the settlement a\nsecret, telling only Robert England and the Turnbulls. He\nasked Coulson and his wife to move to Valdes, so that Cecilia\ncould be a companion to Myrtle and look after her during her\npregnancy. Like some royal magician in an ancient kingdom,\nTurnbull cast the horoscope of the unborn child. His calcu-\nlations confirmed that the child was indeed an adept, the\nWorld Teacher and Avatar that Brother XII had predicted\nwould come to found and stabilize the sixth sub-race.\nUpon his return, Brother XII met with a small group of dis-\nciples waiting with questions about the outcome of the Third\nParty convention in Chicago. “He was very matter-of-fact\nabout it,” recalls Eric Davenport. “He said that things hadn’t\ngone as expected, but that the plans of the Lodge would still\nbe brought into effect— only at a later date. He talked of\nreturning to the East, and said that the predictions he’d made\nwould ultimately be fulfilled.”\nOn Valdes Island, Myrtle contemplated her future and that\nof the child she was carrying. She took long walks on the beach,\npast tide pools teeming with life and twisted red arbutus trees\nthat clung to the shore. She explored the woodland paths that\nled to lovely groves of maple, spruce, and alder in the center\nof the island. She read books that Wilson brought her from\nhis library, and sometimes passed the time of day with the\nworkmen he had employed to build the cabins for the new\nsettlement on Valdes.\n“We used to see her when we were carrying lumber up and\ndown the beach,” one recalls. “It was damn lonely for her over\nthere. She had no one to talk to.”\nWord soon spread about Myrtle’s presence on Valdes. There\n\nOsiris and Isis 111\nwere murmurs of indignation among the disciples when they\ndiscovered that Brother XII had taken a mistress. Elma Wilson\nwas shocked. Maurice Von Platen and Robert DeLuce de-\nmanded an explanation. Brother XII impatiently told them\nthat Myrtle was his soul mate and that they had important\nwork to accomplish together. Their relationship was a neces-\nsary part of the plan of the Masters, he claimed, and couldn’t\nbe judged according to the usual conventions of society.\nBut Brother XII now made a strategic mistake. He brought\nMyrtle to Cedar, so that they could meditate together inside\nthe House of Mystery. The two retreated into the cabin to\ncontinue their esoteric work. Under the dark trees and the\nstarry sky, they embraced—Osiris and Isis in union with the\nAbsolute. The disciples were scandalized: Brother XII’s use\nof the House of Mystery for sex desecrated the sacred retreat.\nTheir indignation flared into open revolt.\nA little group of idealists grimly confronted Brother XII\nand Myrtle when they emerged from the House of Mystery.\nThe whispering of the forest was the only sound in the tense\nmoment before they condemned the conduct of their leader.\nBut Brother XII, as always, justified his actions. His relationship\nwith Myrtle was not the mere infatuation of two personalities,\nhe explained, but existed on a higher plane. He and Myrtle\nwere initiates engaged in work that was presently beyond the\nunderstanding of the disciples.\nBrother XII responded to criticism of his affair by publishing\nan article in The Chalice about marriage. It was a vigorous attack\non what he claimed was the dictatorial jurisdiction assumed\nover marriage by Church and State. In the article, he identi-\nfied three types of marriage. The first type was based primarily\nupon sexual attraction, and included the vast majority of mar-\nriages. It was, by its very nature, impermanent, yet the Church\ncommitted the partners in such a marriage to a lifetime sexual\ncontract, terminable only by death. An arbitrary system tried\nto make permanent and exclusive an attraction that was by\nnature ephemeral and transitory: “That this should be perpe-\n\n112 B R O T H E R X I I\ntrated and erected into a national institution is nothing less\nthan a tragedy.” If the sex-attraction were rightly understood\nand appreciated, he argued, then unwise and consequently\nunhappy marriages would be eliminated. Marriage would no\nlonger be the sole passport to a mutual sex-relationship, and\nyoung people would not suffer the appalling effects of repres-\nsion imposed by centuries of theological dogma. Although he\nfavoured a larger degree of emancipation in sexual matters,\nBrother XII stressed that he was not advocating sexual licence\nor lawlessness.\nThe second type of marriage he described was the marriage\nof companionship. It was not the result of a passing sexual\nemotion, but was founded upon a mental and spiritual af-\nfinity. It was likely to become permanent as the bonds of true\ncompanionship strengthened over time, “especially if it be not\njeopardized by the imposition of a galling ‘legal’ yoke.”\nThe third and highest type of marriage was the marriage of\ntwo initiates. This type of marriage, he explained, could only\nbe consummated by couples who understood the hidden in-\nfluences and invisible laws which affected the union of the\nsoul with the physical body:\nIn such a case, physical union is undertaken deliberately\nand for the express purpose of providing a particular kind\nand quality of physical vehicle for \na known type of incoming\nsoul. The question of sexual gratification does not enter\ninto such a union at all—it is, in effect, a dedication, the\npayment of a debt to that soul for whose benefit the act is\nundertaken.\nWhen the purpose of such a union has been accomplished,\nthere is no obligation for its indefinite perpetuation; that\nis a matter which must be decided by the individuals con-\ncerned—no third party has any shadow of right to interfere\nin this decision or to dictate it. Such a marriage as this is\nconcerned exclusively with spiritual verities—its physical as-\npects are merely incidental.\n\nOsiris and Isis 113\nIf Brother XII intended the article to silence his critics, he\nmiscalculated. It had the opposite effect, creating still more\ncontroversy. His detractors seized upon it, accusing him of\npromulgating a doctrine of free love. There were others, how-\never, who did not think it strange that the birth of certain\nhighly evolved souls should take place outside the conven-\ntional social contract of marriage.\nIn an article in \nThe Chalice, “Incoming Souls,” Coulson\nTurnbull elaborated upon Brother XII’s teachings. He ex-\nplained that these revolutionary souls would be conceived in\naccordance with an exact astrological knowledge and would\nbe born only to parents with higher mental and spiritual fac-\nulties. He said that such souls would choose their parentage\nand time of birth. Such unions would demand a new un-\nderstanding of ethics and would not always be sanctioned\nby convention. “This will bring a clash in the near future,”\nTurnbull predicted, “between civil and ecclesiastical laws of\nman, if unchanged, and the rights of Those who enter on the\npath of the very gods.”\nr r r\nThe Aquarian Foundation was in crisis. Brother XII’s re-\nlationship with Myrtle Baumgartner and his teachings on\nmarriage had left the members divided. While some of them\ncontinued to support Brother XII unquestioningly, others like\nVon Platen and DeLuce were increasingly critical of him.\nThe establishment of the Mandieh Settlement on Valdes\nIsland also caused friction. Brother XII didn’t discuss his\nplans for Valdes with either Von Platen or DeLuce. He didn’t\neven mention them to Edward Lucas. He seemed determined\nto proceed with the new settlement on his own, without con-\nsulting the other Governors.\n“We’d hear a truck rumbling down the road to the water-\nfront in the middle of the night,” Frances Lucas recalls. “He was\ntaking building materials and supplies over to Valdes Island.”\n\n114 B R O T H E R X I I\nBrother XII would navigate with precision across the dark\nwater, skilfully guiding his vessel through the treacherous nar-\nrows to Valdes Island. He’d unload the supplies in the tiny bay\non the east side, then make the return trip to Cedar the same\nnight.\n“I’d be asleep in the Center Building,” remembers Eric\nDavenport, “when I’d hear a rap on the window. It would be\nBrother XII and Robert England. I’d go downstairs and let\nthem in. It would be pitch-black. They came and went in the\ndead of night.”\nIn order to provide himself with transportation to the new\ncolony, Wilson ordered a powerful tugboat built at Foster’s\nShipyard in Victoria at a cost of five thousand dollars. Von\nPlaten and DeLuce were alarmed when they learned that such\na large expenditure had been made from Foundation funds\nwithout their knowledge.\nBrother XII called the new settlement on Valdes Island The\nMandieh Settlement after the birthplace of the god Osiris\nin the Nile delta in Egypt. In an article in \nThe Chalice, he\nexplained that the new colony was the next step in the devel-\nopment of the Work. It would be the place where disciples\nwould receive the practical occult training that would prepare\nthem for their future work. Applicants had to be willing to\nentirely abandon the life of the outer world: “This means the\nrenunciation of worldly possessions. . . The aspirant upon this\nPath must strip himself before he may pass through the eye\nof the needle—the gate which admits one to association with\nthe inner Brotherhood of the world. If there is a position you\nvalue or hope to attain, if there is a sum of money you wish to\nobtain or to retain, if there is the marriage you have set your\nheart upon, then the Path is not for you—yet.”\nBrother XII explained that the nativity of the individual\nwould be of key importance: “He or she must have brought\nover the needed qualifications from a former life, as there is\nnot time to develop them in this. Also, ‘the stars do not lie’;\nthere is no possibility of deception or of self-deception if the\n\nOsiris and Isis 115\nchart of the soul is made the chief determining factor.”\nOn a more mundane level, he assailed what he condemned\nas two of the most devastating evils in modern society—\ncuriosity and criticism. In order that the right conditions\ncould be maintained at the colony, “the very first rule of the\nMandieh Settlement will be MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.”\nHe itemized the essential qualifications for admittance. The\napplicant had to be:\nBroad minded\nUnconventional\nUnselfish\nCourageous against ‘opinions’\nUncritical of others\nNot curious\nFree from garrulity\nNaturally silent\nLoyal to associates\nNot to be turned aside.\nAlthough few would qualify to live at the Mandieh Settle-\nment, Brother XII explained that souls of the incoming sixth\nsub-race would soon be incarnating in increasing numbers as\nchildren of the colony’s members. The Mandieh Settlement\nwould be the physical entry point for these adepts, an environ-\nment where they would have the proper physical, mental, and\nspiritual conditions for their development. He concluded:\n“Some time ago, I said—‘We have to change the thought-\ncurrents of the world.’ If we change the thoughts of men, we\nchange all the forms and institutions they have built up—we\nsubstitute good for evil in every department of human life.\nThe foundations of this Work will be laid here at The Mandieh\nSettlement.”\nOn September 15, 1928, the Governors of the Aquarian\nFoundation held an urgent meeting in Edward Lucas’s law\n\n116 B R O T H E R X I I\noffice in the Standard Bank Building in Vancouver. DeLuce\ntold Lucas that the workmen on Valdes thought Wilson was\ncrazy—he was giving contradictory orders and would fly into\na rage over the smallest thing. Turnbull said that despite his\narticles in \nThe Chalice, he had serious doubts about Wilson’s\nsanity, which was why he and Cecilia had returned to Cedar.\nVon Platen was angry about the money he’d given Wilson for\nthe P.P.L.—it had all been spent, and the organization was a\nshambles. He said they had to prevent Wilson from squan-\ndering the remainder of the Society’s funds and suggested\nthey take out an injunction against him. DeLuce wondered if\nthey could have Wilson certified insane and committed to an\nasylum. Lucas advised against such an extreme action. He sug-\ngested the Governors hold a meeting with Wilson to give him\na chance to explain himself. If they weren’t satisfied with his\nanswers, they could then decide how best to extricate them-\nselves from the situation.\nThree days later, six of the Governors filed through the\nFrench doors inside the Center Building, past Wilson’s office,\nand down the hallway to the auditorium. In their suits and\nties, they looked like executives attending a board meeting,\nrather than the earthly representatives of an occult hierarchy\nresponsible for the destiny of the planet. They seated them-\nselves around the table: Wilson and Robert England on one\nside; Von Platen, DeLuce, and Turnbull on the other. Osten-\nsibly neutral, Edward Lucas would mediate the dispute.\nLucas opened the meeting by explaining that the dissenting\nGovernors felt that Wilson had radically departed from the\noriginal tenets of the Society. Von Platen and DeLuce de-\nmanded an explanation for Wilson’s recent conduct. Wilson\nbristled at this challenge to his authority. He declared that his\nactions were directed by the Lodge and were the next stage\nin the development of the Work. The meeting quickly got out\nof control as the Governors voiced their disapproval of the\nway in which Wilson was running the Foundation. When his\naffair with Myrtle Baumgartner was raised, Wilson became\n\nOsiris and Isis 117\nirate. He accused the other Governors of being traitors to the\nWork. Von Platen demanded that he surrender control of the\nFoundation or agree to dissolve it. Wilson refused, abruptly\ndeclaring the meeting adjourned.\nThe Governors emerged from the Center Building, their\nfaces telling the story to the disciples waiting outside. Lucas\nstayed behind to talk to Wilson. He suggested that they take\na walk around the property. Wilson agreed. As the two men\nstrolled side-by-side past the neat houses of the community,\nLucas recalled their early days together, when they’d drawn\nup the Society’s constitution on his dining room table. He\nreminisced about the discussions they’d had and the excite-\nment he’d felt at watching the colony grow. And finally, he\nquietly explained why he and the others could no longer, in\nconscience, continue to act as Governors of the Society. Wilson\nlistened carefully. He replied that he understood Lucas’s con-\ncern; nonetheless, he couldn’t let control of the Work pass\nout of his hands. Lucas was amazed that Wilson expected the\nothers to function as dummy Governors of the Society. Lucas\ntold him that such an arrangement would never work.\nThe two returned to the Center Building. Wilson was quiet\nfor a moment. Then he announced that he’d changed his\nmind—he was willing to dissolve the Foundation after all.\nLucas was greatly relieved. It was the only answer: Brother XII\ncould go his way and the other Governors could go theirs.\nThe two men shook hands—they were still “Brothers.”\nThat afternoon Brother XII sent a notice, much less ami-\nable in tone, to Von Platen, DeLuce, and Turnbull, informing\nthem that their membership in the Foundation had been\ncancelled: “By reason of your recent attempt to overturn the\nconstitution of the Aquarian Foundation and to seize control\nof our Order, you are one and all the self-declared enemies\nof this Work. Your nominal membership in this Order is can-\ncelled as from noon on the 18th of September, 1928.” He also\ninformed them that if any other members of the Foundation\ncommunicated with them or set foot upon their property, that\n\n118 B R O T H E R X I I\nindividual’s membership in the Society would be automati-\ncally cancelled.\nWilson was up early the next morning. He typed a letter\nto Lucas, explaining that the recent events had been a test.\nVon Platen, DeLuce, and Turnbull had failed it: “Treachery\nand instability have been revealed and those who would have\nbetrayed this Cause, or deserted it in a moment of stress,\nhave been broken.” He assured Lucas, “As for yourself, good\nBrother, unless I mistake it, you will have come through the\ntesting; you will have qualified to pass from the nominal to\nthe real.”\nLucas replied that although he was gratified the Skipper\nfelt this way about him, he still couldn’t continue with him in\nthe Work. Dissolving the Foundation meant the end of their\nvoyage together:\nIn short, this cruise is over. The ship we have made it in\nwill be laid up and the crew paid off. And if I, as a mate,\ncontemplated the possible painful duty of putting the\nSkipper in irons, I am happily spared from such a task. .\n. You will carry on in the service in a new ship. I do not\nsee my way clear to sign on for the new cruise, but I cer-\ntainly have no kick coming now about the voyage that is\nclosing. If I have thought the Old Man was loony and fi-\nnally up and said so—well, I suppose that is a way mates\nhave. I am well content that what you would have re-\ngarded as mutiny will not now have to take place.\nWilson wasn’t ready to let Lucas go. He wanted him as a\nfriend and ally, and believed their work together was not yet\nfinished:\nGood Brother, a word to you as to the Realities. . .Without\nrealizing it \nyet, you are taking part in the fulfilment of a cer-\ntain passage from Revelations. Read what is said about the\ntwo Witnesses—how they were slain, and their bodies lay\n\nOsiris and Isis 119\nin the streets for three days. I ask you, have we not borne wit-\nness? Is there any other witness comparable to it in these\nlast days? Our witness to the world of soul and spirit is this\nWork—the Aquarian Foundation. Our witness to the world\nof outer affairs was the P.P.L. Read \nThe End of the Days, and\nsee if any other witness is equal to it. Both of these have now\nbeen “slain.”\nBrother, follow your intuitions and they will not lead\nyou wrongly. You have seen my actions, and you can gauge\nwhether I am honest or not. You have seen also those\nothers. Make your choice. Remember that on the third day,\nthe Witness shall arise again. It is for you to have a part in\nthat resurrection, and part in its preparation, for much will\nbe done in silence during the “three days.” You may have\na part in it, and in that which follows, \nbecause you are honest.\nLucas was no doubt puzzled by Brother XII’s cryptic utter-\nance. He would soon discover there was more to the prophecy\nthan rhetoric.\nr r r\nA week later, Wilson and Robert England met Lucas at\nthe Hotel Georgia in Vancouver to discuss the legal ramifi-\ncations of dissolving the Aquarian Foundation. Wilson asked\nLucas what would become of the assets when the Society was\ndissolved. Lucas explained that by law they would have to\nbe distributed equally among the seven Governors. Wilson\nprotested that this was unfair and would defeat the intentions\nof the various donors who had contributed to the Society.\n“I’m perfectly convinced there’s a scheme on between\nDeLuce and Von Platen to split the outfit and get control\nof the finances,” he said. “I’m taking pains to see there’ll be\nnothing left to plunder.”\n“Well, you needn’t be concerned about finances being plun-\ndered,” Lucas answered. “Von Platen is a man of means.”\n\n120 B R O T H E R X I I\nIf the assets were divided, Wilson argued, people who’d\nworked hard for the organization wouldn’t receive proper\ncompensation. Robert England, for example, was being paid\nonly fifty dollars a month. “Bob is entitled to at least three-\nhundred dollars a month from the time he first came to us,”\nWilson said, “and I want to make sure that he gets it!”\nLucas asked about Mary Connally’s donation, but Wilson\ncut him off—“Nothing doing! That twenty-five thousand dol-\nlars is mine!”\nLucas brought up the Hess Trust: What did Wilson intend\nto do with it?\n“I’ll arrange that as best I may with Mr. Hess,” Wilson re-\nplied. “I’m satisfied that he’ll want to divert those funds into\nmy own hands.”\nRealizing that Wilson was in no mood for debate, Lucas went\nahead and explained the legal procedure that would have\nto be followed to dissolve the Society. The Governors would\nhave to formally pass a resolution, then make application\nto the Supreme Court of British Columbia, requesting that\nthe Society be dissolved. Lucas advised him that the notices\ncalling the meeting had to be sent out two weeks in advance.\nHe suggested that Wilson mail them out immediately, before\nany further misunderstandings could arise.\nThe meeting ended. Lucas returned to his office, and Wilson\nand England went up to their rooms in the hotel. Wilson was\nobviously upset at the prospect of having his work brought\ndown in ruins by what he considered the treachery of his\nfellow Governors. He felt a particular enmity towards Coulson\nTurnbull. Snatching up some hotel stationery, he scribbled a\nmemo to his former associate, threatening to expose intimate\ndetails of his personal life:\n“The attempt of yourself and co-conspirators to intimi-\ndate me has failed. How completely it has failed, I will now\nprove to you. I (not you) am going to force a full disclo-\nsure of everything, and myself publish all the facts. I mean\nEVERYTHING —not what you call everything.”\n\nOsiris and Isis 121\nWilson threatened to take Turnbull and the others to court\nand to reveal Turnbull’s liaison with a woman living in Victoria:\n“I will show (prove) that you had been living with her as your\nmistress, and I will show the connection of this frame-up with\nthe present plot.\n“I will also relate what you told me of your ‘vision’ of Cecilia\non the stairs, in all its indecency, and if you are hardy, will\nforce Cecilia to testify under \noath as to whether or not she\nknows of that vision.”\nRunning out of stationery, Wilson tore off a couple of blank\nCN telegraph forms and finished off:\n“Lest you should think I am trying to intimidate you, I repeat\nthat whatever you do, or do not do, I will force a full \npublic dis-\nclosure of everything—of many other matters also which will\nhit some of the others fatally. Your safest course is to disappear\nfrom Vancouver and from this province while you can—your\nshortest way would be over the end of the wharf. Whether you\ngo or stay, I will force \neverything into the open.”\nThere was one Governor at the headquarters who took\nno part in the dispute. Phillip Fisher had resigned from the\nAquarian Foundation on September 8, but for some time\nbefore that had been acting strangely. Hyperactive by anyone’s\nstandards, Fisher had become completely manic, talking in-\ncessantly and not sleeping for days.\n“I remember him dashing up onto the porch of the Center\nBuilding,” Eric Davenport says. “His eyes were bugged out like\nsaucers. He told us he’d had a message—he’d been chosen by\nthe Masters to be the next leader! He was so excited, he was\ndrooling. Then he dashed off. \nBoom! Boom! Boom! Just like\nthat!”\nSixteen-year-old Frances Lucas became the object of Fish-\ner’s romantic affections. “Poor Phil really went off the deep\nend,” she recalls. “He had a crush on me. He wrote me letters\nfull of astrological symbolism, hinting that we were to have a\nchild together—one of the great souls of the sixth sub-race.\n\n122 B R O T H E R X I I\nMy father soon put a stop to that!”\nFisher’s delusions eventually became obvious even to him-\nself and he entered an asylum. The little poem he inscribed\nin Frances’s autograph book before he left the colony gives a\nglimpse into his exalted state of mind:\nOh hail O Earth that gave me birth,\nI stand upon my feet,\nI bring again the Laws of Love,\nVenus returns complete.\n“See that ye love one another.”\nFisher’s injunction was ironic, given the present state of af-\nfairs at the headquarters. The atmosphere was one of suspicion\nand hostility. The road which ran past the Center Building\nand down to the water marked the dividing line between the\nenemy camps. The houses of Von Platen, DeLuce, and the\nSquiers stood on one side of the road; those of Wilson, the\nBarleys, and the Hobarts stood on the other. The two groups\nconfined themselves to their individual properties in a state of\nuneasy truce.\nBrother XII, meanwhile, drew up the notices calling the\nGeneral Meeting at which the Governors would vote to dis-\nsolve the Foundation. He explained to Lucas that dissolving\nthe Society was an important step in a new stage of the Work\nand was “part of the Plan itself.” It would have been under-\ntaken “quite independently of any of those treacheries and\ndeceits of which Von Platen and his associates stand con-\nvicted,” and like every other important matter connected with\nthe Work, would be done at the proper time: “The date of\nthe actual meeting will accord with the correct planetary in-\nfluences for that work. It will be done during the month of\nOctober and neither Von Platen, nor anyone else, will put it\nforward or delay it because it must be done at the appointed\ntime and no other.”\n\nOsiris and Isis 123\nHe advised Lucas that he intended to shut down The Chalice\nand refund the subscriptions. In addition, he wished to refund\nthe donations of a number of individuals who’d contributed\ntheir savings to the Foundation, expecting to live indefinitely\nat the Center under the shelter of the Work. It was his respon-\nsibility, he said, to safeguard their interests and see that they\ndid not suffer any financial hardship as a result of the Society\nbeing dissolved.\nThe next issue of \nThe Chalice was at Filmers Printers in\nNanaimo, about to be printed. It contained an extraordinary\narticle by Brother XII. Eric Davenport had proofread it:\n“Oh, it was a fabulous thing! It was about this magic ring\nthat had been given to him by the Masters. Somehow, when\nhe was on the ship coming to America, he lost this ring in the\nmiddle of the ocean. But then, by means of the white \nchelas,\nas he called them, he came into possession of it again when\nhe was in \nsamadhi. He gave this ring to Myrtle Baumgartner. It\nwas the most fabulous ring you could imagine! He showed it\nto Bob England and some other people there. I never saw it,\nbut it was supposed to be something fantastic—one of these\nrings that has magic powers associated with it.\n“But when this trouble came up with Von Platen, this Osiris-\nIsis business, I guess he thought they’d use this article against\nhim as proof of his being demented or something. So he\ndrove straight to Nanaimo and had it destroyed. He told us\nthe printers had broken up the plates, put them in the melting\npot. He had the only copy—the galley proof. But oh! I wanted\na copy of that article! It was a fabulous thing!”\nBrother XII now issued a General Letter to the members, in-\nforming them of the crisis at the headquarters. “A small group,\ndriven by pride and personal ambition, have tried to seize by\nfraud or force the leadership of the Aquarian Foundation and\nthe chief places in it,” he wrote. He identified the conspir-\nators as “Moritz” Von Platen, Robert DeLuce, and Coulson\nTurnbull, and explained that they’d all known each other in\nPasadena, had formed a distinct group at the Center, and had\n\n124 B R O T H E R X I I\nnever assimilated.\n“These people, thinking they saw a ‘good thing’ in the\nA.F., joined the outer Society, and were profuse in their\nprotestations of loyalty and service. EVENTS HAVE NOW\nPROVEN BEYOND DOUBT OR DENIAL that their plan\nwas to work themselves into positions of confidence or\nresponsibility. DeLuce was to use his work in the Aquarian\nFoundation to spread his ideas on ‘physical regeneration’\nand, incidentally, to ‘boost his own stock.’ We have no interest\nin regeneration—our interest is in spiritual truths, and we will\nnot have this work brought down to any other level.”\nHe accused DeLuce of wanting to have his wife installed\nas his own confidential secretary, and Von Platen of making\na bid to gain financial control by suggesting that he be made\nSecretary-Treasurer. “All of these moves were, of course, made\nin ‘a spirit of service’ and with a view to ‘lightening the heavy\nburden’ I was personally carrying. Every one of these plans\nfailed—Robert was given no chance to spread his theories;\nMyrtle DeLuce got no ‘confidential’ position; and I refused\nto give Von Platen any voice in the financial affairs of the\nA.F. When they realized that guile had failed, they decided to\nthrow off the mask and to obtain by force what they had failed\nto get by fraud. They determined to depose me, if possible by\na general vote and on the grounds of maladministration, or by\nany other charges they might bring against me.”\nBrother XII claimed that he’d been aware of the plot since\nMay, but he had allowed it to develop so that the exposure\nof the conspirators might be final and complete. “I have de-\ncided to cut all knots at one blow. I SHALL SHORTLY TAKE\nSTEPS TO DISSOLVE THE AQUARIAN FOUNDATION\nAS A LEGALLY INCORPORATED SOCIETY. There will be\nnothing to shoot at, nothing to plunder, nothing to trap by\nlegal trickery, and no ‘Society’ to tempt men to scheme for\npersonal place and leadership.” The outer organization had\nserved its purpose, he declared—that of a drag-net into which\nhad been drawn the fit and the unfit. It was now the time of\n\nOsiris and Isis 125\nwinnowing and separation. The present crisis was a test. It\nwould decide which members were of the sixth sub-race spirit,\nand which were “self-deceived, conventional, bound by tra-\ndition, entirely of the fifth. . . Those who have in them the\nnature and spirit of the Work, and who remain faithful, shall\ngo forward to better things—they shall ‘pass over to the other\nside.’”\nAt the same time, Brother XII wrote to Oliver Hess with\nnews of the crisis: “Dear Brother, I have no time to provide you\nwith complete details, but you will recall I wrote you earlier\nabout Von Platen, who wished to take over the financial man-\nagement of the Work. He is now heading what is practically\na revolution—has tried to get me deposed and contemplates\nan injunction so as to tie up all the funds.” He explained that\nhe had to dissolve the Aquarian Foundation to rid himself of\nthe rebellious Governors, but that unfortunately, upon dis-\nsolution, the Foundation’s assets would have to be divided\namong the statutory Governors of the Society. The Hess Trust\nwould be disbursed. To prevent this calamity, Hess would have\nto sign the new Trust Agreement he enclosed, which would\nconvey the securities to Wilson personally. He urged Hess to\nexecute the document without delay, thereby safeguarding\nthe securities for the future Work: “Brother, the moment is\ncritical and calls for instant action. If you would help me to\nsave the Cause, act at once.”\nBrother XII also wrote to Mary Connally in Asheville, North\nCarolina. He explained that he needed to protect her twenty-\nfive thousand dollar contribution from being divided among\nthose who sought to destroy the Work. He included an af-\nfidavit which stated that her donation was intended for his\nexclusive use, in order to forward the Work in whatever way\nhe judged best, and that without his consent, no other person\nor organization should participate in it:\n“I told you when we met that what you could do for this\nWork would soon be made clear. This is at once your testing\nand your great opportunity. Have faith in the righteousness of\n\n126 B R O T H E R X I I\nour cause, and of my own motive, and—you will have saved the\nwhole of our Work on the physical plane.”\nHe urged Mary to return the executed document to him\nimmediately in case any attempt was made to tie up the funds.\n“That done, good sister, pack your bags and come here as\nquickly as you may. I want you to see everything for yourself, to\nsee these others, their work and their methods, just to judge as\nbetween them and ourselves. Only thus shall you judge clearly\nbetween the truth and a lie, between the true man and the\ntraitor.”\nHe also explained to Mary that he’d known about the plot\nagainst the Work from its very inception:\nSister, all was foreseen, foretold, and prepared for—it is\npart of the Plan. The purpose of the outer work is done; the\nreal work, the work of the inner order, is about to begin,\nand in that work, you shall have your part. Unconsciously,\nour enemies are playing into our hands. When the truth is\nrevealed, they will see that they have not even touched our\nWork, while they themselves will have lost all.\nAs for ourselves, we fight the good fight, neither dis-\ncouraged nor dismayed. Those who are for us are greater\nnow, far greater, than those that be against us.\n“If you can hear the words which you have spoken\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\nIf you can see the things you gave your life for, broken,\nAnd stoop and build them up with worn-out tools. . .”\n\n127\nCHAPTER\nV\nCharges and Counter-Charges\nT\nhe small town of Nanaimo bustled with activity on\nthe last Saturday morning of September 1928. Inside\nSpencer’s Department Store, families stocked\nup with their weekly groceries, while across the street at\nFletcher’s, mothers purchased sheet music for young prodigies\nand exchanged gossip with the ladies from the church choir.\nAt Billy Gray’s tobacco store, Nanaimo’s gentry mixed with\ncoal miners in blackened coveralls to choose from an aromatic\nselection of cigarettes, cut plug, pipes, and expensive imported\ntobacco. Nearby at the Palace of Sweets, children begged\ntheir parents for licorice sticks and aniseed balls, and at the\nWindsor Hotel, thirsty patrons quaffed their first draught of\nthe day. Motorists in caps and goggles headed out of town for\nthe ball game, while at the corner of Commercial and Church\nstreets, local businessmen settled up their weekly accounts in\nthe impressive, classically columned edifice of the Canadian\nBank of Commerce.\n\n128 B R O T H E R X I I\nOn this morning of September 29, Robert England,\nSecretary-Treasurer of the Aquarian Foundation, walked\npurposefully across the threshold of Nanaimo’s main temple of\nfinance and into the cool marble interior. The tellers working\nbriskly behind the counters knew England well, since he was\nin practically every day on Foundation business. When he\nstepped up to the wicket and greeted Albert Hazell, the teller\nnoticed that the usually cheerful and self-confident England\nseemed nervous.\nToday, England had an unusual request. He passed across\nto Hazell two cheques endorsed to himself. One was for\n$2,000; the other for $800. Hazell remarked that it was a large\nwithdrawal. England replied that he needed the money to put\na deal through. Hazell suggested certified cheques or a bank\ndraft, but England insisted that he needed cash. Overhearing\nthe exchange, the manager came over and asked England why\nhe needed such a large sum in cash.\n“I need it to make a deposit on something,” England\nreplied, looking quite uncomfortable.\nHazell replied that he had no large bills—only\ntwenties. England deliberated for a moment, then took back\nthe cheques and left.\nRobert England had been the one Governor who had\nsupported Brother XII during the crisis at the headquar-\nters. He’d been Wilson’s staunch friend and ally, and his\ncontribution as Secretary-Treasurer had been invaluable.\nA brilliant accountant with a shrewd business sense, he had\npurchased equipment and supplies for the Foundation at\nbargain prices and had often provided Wilson with key finan-\ncial advice. But England had recently decided that he could\nno longer work with Brother XII.\nOn the fifth of October, England returned to the Bank of\nCommerce, and again presented the two cheques to Albert\nHazell.\n“I will have the cash now,” he said.\nHazell explained that he still didn’t have any large bills—all\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 129\nhe had was twenties.\n“They will do,” England replied.\nHazell counted out $2,800 in twenty-dollar bills. England\npocketed the money and left.\nThe next morning, England made a special trip to Seattle,\nwhere he rented a safety deposit box in a downtown bank. He put\nthe $2,800 into the box, and returned to Cedar the same day.\nOn the ninth of October, England walked into Wilson’s\noffice in the Center Building and announced that he was\nresigning from the Aquarian Foundation. At the same time,\nhe explained to Wilson that he’d taken $2,800 from the bank\nas payment for services rendered. England’s resignation took\nWilson completely by surprise. He asked him what right he\nhad to the money. England replied that he was entitled to it,\nand reminded Wilson of his statement to Lucas and Fisher—\nwhen he’d made England a Governor of the Society—that his\nwork had saved the Foundation from ruin. He also recalled the\nrecent meeting at the Hotel Georgia at which Wilson had told\nLucas that England was easily worth $300 a month, and that\nwhen the Society was dissolved, he was going to make sure that\nhe received it. England explained that as a bookkeeper he was\nnormally paid $250 a month, $600 a month when employed\nby the United States government. He’d been receiving a salary\nof only $50 a month from the Foundation, he pointed out,\nand had served for fourteen months with an altruistic motive,\nonly to discover that he’d been unwittingly assisting Wilson\nin building up a large sum of money for himself. Therefore,\nsince he was entitled to $250 a month for his services, he was\ntaking the balance of the amount that was owed him—$200 a\nmonth for fourteen months. England attached two receipts to\nhis resignation: one for $2,000, as payment for his services to\nthe Aquarian Foundation; another for $800, as payment for\nhis services to the Mandieh Settlement.\nAlthough caught off guard by England’s defection, Wilson\nquickly recovered. That evening, he discussed England’s res-\nignation with Edward Lucas, explaining that England had\n\n130 B R O T H E R X I I\ntaken the $2,800 from the Mandieh Settlement Fund—the ac-\ncount to which Mary Connally’s $25,000 donation had been\ndeposited.\n“I have this document,” he said, showing Lucas the affidavit\nwhich Mary had sent to him. “Will it hold water?”\nLucas read it over. The affidavit stated unequivocally that\nthe $25,000 Mary had contributed was for Wilson’s own per-\nsonal use and did not belong to the Aquarian Foundation.\n“Certainly,” he replied. “It seems to solve your difficulties.”\nThe following evening, England said farewell to Wilson in\nhis office in the Center Building. He planned to leave the\nheadquarters the next morning. Whatever resentment or\nbitterness Wilson might have harboured towards his former\nSecretary-Treasurer was not expressed.\n“My bedroom door was open,” recalls Eric Davenport, “and\nI heard voices coming from the office. I crept out onto the\nlanding and listened to the conversation for awhile. They\nwere discussing this money Bob had taken, but Wilson seemed\npleased enough about it. ‘Yes, Bob; that’s fine,’ he said. I even\nheard him chuckle a few times. He thanked Bob for his ser-\nvices and wished him luck.”\nAt six o’clock the next morning, Davenport was warming\nup the car in front of the Center Building. England carried\ntwo suitcases to the waiting vehicle and stowed them in the\nback seat. He climbed in beside Davenport and the car slowly\ndrove out through the Foundation gates. It made the turn\nonto Holden-Corso Road, its wheels scattering the morning\nmist. Picking up speed, the car headed towards Nanaimo.\nEngland’s disillusionment with Brother XII had been\ngradual, forced upon him by an accumulation of small but\ntelling incidents. He was grateful his departure had been\namicable. His immediate destination was Seattle, where he\nplanned to retrieve the $2,800 from the safety-deposit box\nbefore returning to California.\nAt the CPR dock in Nanaimo, the \nPrincess Elaine was taking\non passengers for the seven o’clock sailing to Vancouver.\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 131\nDavenport helped England carry his luggage to the ferry\nand told him he’d miss him. The two shook hands and said\ngoodbye. In a sombre mood, the young secretary drove back\nto Cedar.\nBrother XII was also up early that morning. His good\nhumour of the night before had vanished. The underlying\nhostility he felt towards England had erupted into vindictive\nrage. He sat at his typewriter and hammered out a letter to this\nfinal Aquarian Foundation Governor who had betrayed him:\n“Some time ago, I gave you a position of trust, and my full\nconfidence in the handling of funds and accounts. You have\ndeliberately betrayed that trust.”\nWilson charged in the letter that England’s action of taking\nthe $2,800 \nwas illegal, and that his refusal to refund it con-\nvicted him of embezzlement. He demanded that he return\nthe money immediately:\nThe purpose of this letter is to give you a chance to make\nfull restitution of the money you have illegally taken. I ask,\nand expect you to answer the following questions—\n1. Have you deposited the money in any bank; if so, in\nwhat bank and in whose name?\n2. Have you retained the notes yourself or have you given\nthem, or any part of them, into the hands of a third party\nto hold?\n3. Will you repay the full amount of two thousand, eight\nhundred dollars into the account from which you drew it,\nbefore noon today, October 11th, 1928?\nAfter finishing the letter, Wilson frantically searched the\npremises for England, not realizing he’d intended to leave so\nearly. When Eric Davenport pulled up in front of the Center\nBuilding, Wilson hurried over to him. The young secretary was\nbarely out of the car before the furious leader confronted him.\n“He was fuming, absolutely fuming!” recalls Davenport.\n“He asked me where Bob was. I said I’d driven him into town.\n\n132 B R O T H E R X I I\nThen he asked me how many grips he’d taken. I wondered\njust what—if anything—he could do to Bob, so I said, ‘One\ngrip.’ But, of course, there were two.”\nWilson realized England was leaving the country. Grabbing\nthe keys from Davenport, he jumped into the car and drove\noff.\nTwenty minutes later, Wilson was in the Nanaimo police\nstation, laying a charge of theft against Robert England.\nImmediately afterwards in the police court next door, he\nswore out a warrant for his arrest before Magistrate C.H.\nBeevor-Potts.\nSergeant Jack Russell placed a phone call to Vancouver.\nWhen the \nPrincess Elaine docked at the CPR wharf, two police\nofficers were waiting to take England into custody. To his cha-\ngrin, they informed him he was under arrest.\nThat evening, England was taken back to Nanaimo under\npolice escort and was locked up to await his preliminary\nhearing. In his cramped cell, he had plenty of time to adjust to\nthe fact that his association with Brother XII wasn’t over yet.\nAfter returning to the headquarters, Wilson went looking\nfor his secretary. He found him outside the Center Building.\n“He threatened me,” recalls Davenport. “He said he’d seen\na great many people railroaded—innocent young people sent\nto jail for years. And all the time he was talking, his hand was\non the handle of this Colt .32 sticking out of the inside pocket\nof his suit jacket.”\nWilson stalked off, leaving Davenport to imagine the worst.\nThe terrified youth spent a sleepless night, dreading what\nBrother XII might do to him.\nThe following morning, Wilson came up to Davenport’s\nroom. His demeanour was quite different—not menacing at\nall. He just wanted to borrow a cigarette. Summoning up his\ncourage, Davenport confronted him:\n“I said to him, ‘You threatened me yesterday, Brother XII,\nand I didn’t like it!’\n“Oh, he was as charming as he could be! ‘No, Eric,’ he said,\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 133\n‘I didn’t threaten you; I wouldn’t do such a thing!’ And he\ncackled this cackly kind of laugh.”\nThe next morning, Davenport received a letter from Wilson,\ninforming him that his services were no longer required.\nDavenport was hugely relieved: he was too unnerved to work\nanyway. He packed his bags, said goodbye to the Barleys and\nthe Hobarts, and hopped into Jim Lippincott’s truck for the\nride back to Vancouver.\n“I was scared to death!” he recalls. “Just a little greenhorn\nkid fresh out of school! I was a nervous wreck by the time I got\nhome!”\nThe strain of events was taking its toll on Wilson, too. He\ntook to his bed in a state of nervous exhaustion. Sitting up in\nhis dressing gown, he wrote a general letter to the group sec-\nretaries of the Aquarian Foundation. “As all my help has quit,\nbeing involved in the present attack upon our Work, it is \nim-\npossible to attend to any correspondence,” he advised them.\n“Please wait for general letters, as I can deal with the present\ncrisis only in that way.”\nWilson also drafted a letter to Oliver Hess, attempting to\nconvince the elderly lawyer to sign over the Hess Trust to him,\n“so that I might bring it into the safety of the present phase of\nthis Work, and not to get anything for myself personally.” Hess\nhad refused to sign the new trust agreement, saying that he\nconsidered it fraudulent and deceitful. Wilson repeated that\nhe was single-handedly fighting a tremendous attack on the\nWork, and promised Hess a “full and satisfactory answer” to\nthe “wicked charges” that had been made against him when\nhe had more time to write: “I am almost distracted with the in-\ncessant work each day.”\nHe also begged Hess not to be swayed or deceived by the\nletters he was certain the other Governors had written him:\n“Remember, Brother, that our simplest obligation is to hear all\nthe story before reaching a decision. You have heard the lies\nwhich are being circulated, and you should be able to judge\nof the motives and the character of those who would circulate\n\n134 B R O T H E R X I I\nthem. As for me, read what I have written in the past, and the\nrecord of my work.”\nAt the Mandieh Settlement on Valdes Island, work came to\nan abrupt halt. The workmen packed up their tools, disman-\ntled their tents and left. The rain poured down on the deserted\ncolony, soaking through the tarpaulins covering the unfin-\nished cabins and dripping down onto piles of stacked lumber\nand rusting nails. For the time being, the Mandieh Settlement\nremained unfinished—a mournful cluster of buildings on a\nrocky hillside, abandoned to the wind and rain.\nMyrtle Baumgartner also left Valdes, her dream of bearing\nthe next World Teacher shattered by a miscarriage. Cecilia\nTurnbull had nursed her through it, but the loss had devastated\nMyrtle and pushed her to the brink of insanity.\nWhen the other Governors discovered that Horus had\n“slipped his moorings,” as Lucas put it, they took it as further\nevidence that Brother XII was off the track. “If this thing has\nbeen decreed by the gods,” Lucas bluntly asked, “how does it\nhappen that Horus is a miscarriage?”\nBrother XII and Myrtle had tried again, instructing Coulson\nTurnbull to cast a new horoscope for the child. But when\nMyrtle suffered a second miscarriage, her disillusionment and\ngrief resulted in a complete mental breakdown.\n“I only saw her once,” Frances Lucas remembers. “She was\nkind of wild-looking and lost—not at all attractive. I remember\nthis strange, sad-looking creature with dark hair parted in the\nmiddle.\n“Afterwards, I said to Maurice Von Platen, ‘Mrs. Baum-\ngartner didn’t look like much of an “Isis” to me.’ He just said\nin a joking kind of way, ‘Well, you never saw her with her war\npaint on!’”\nHow much emotional support Myrtle received from Brother\nXII is difficult to say, for the relationship between them rap-\nidly disintegrated. She remained in seclusion in the House of\nMystery, struggling to recover from her breakdown, her future\nuncertain.\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 135\nr r r\nOn October 19, 1928, Robert England’s preliminary\nhearing was held in the police court in Nanaimo before Chief\nMagistrate C. H. Beevor-Potts. A stern arbiter of justice, the\ngrey-haired magistrate was almost an institution himself, run-\nning the court with the rigid discipline of a British military\nofficer. England stood as the clerk read the charge. Acting on\nhis behalf was Thomas P. Morton, also known as “The Egg” be-\ncause of his shiny bald head. Local gossip had him spending\nnights on his office couch to escape a nagging wife; taking\nsolace in the bottle, he’d emerge rumpled and dishevelled the\nfollowing morning to face the new day. He was perhaps not\nthe wisest choice of legal counsel.\nRepresenting Wilson was Nanaimo’s leading lawyer, Frank\nS. Cunliffe, who had articled in Lucas’s law office in Vancouver.\nThe thirty-six-year-old Cunliffe was tall and slender and had\na keen intellect. His razor-sharp and logical mind invariably\ndemolished his adversaries’ arguments with ease. He was a for-\nmidable courtroom opponent.\nAlbert Hazell was called as the first witness. He testified\nthat he was a teller at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and\nthat England had authority to draw cheques on the Mandieh\nSettlement Fund account. He described the two occasions\nwhen England had appeared at the bank and identified the\ncheques Cunliffe showed him as the same ones England had\ncashed.\n“And in payment of these two cheques he received alto-\ngether how much?”\n“Two thousand, eight hundred dollars.”\nCunliffe called Wilson to the stand. He testified that Eng-\nland had been employed by him as a clerk and bookkeeper.\nHe said he’d given him the authority to sign cheques as a con-\nvenience to himself in handling the accounts. Cunliffe asked\nhow the Mandieh Settlement Fund had originated.\n“The Mandieh Settlement Fund was a sum of money do-\n\n136 B R O T H E R X I I\nnated to myself for the purpose of carrying out my work. There\nwere no strings attached to it. I talked over the question of the\nsettlement itself with the donor, but otherwise there were no\nconditions attached to it.”\n“What amount of his time would be taken up in connection\nwith this Mandieh Settlement Fund?”\n“I should say that the whole of the work done could\nhave been completed in a very few days if it had been done\nconsecutively. It could have been done by anybody with any\nknowledge of bookkeeping at all. In addition, he went to\nVancouver to buy stores, and he was over there several days.”\n“The bulk of his work consisted of what?”\n“The bulk of his work was clerical work for the Aquarian\nFoundation.”\n“What was the accused paid for his services to the Aquarian\nFoundation?”\n“Fifty dollars a month.”\n“Did he live out there at the settlement at Cedar district?”\n“Yes Sir.”\n“Who paid for his board and provided his lodging?”\n“They had arrangements of their own about board.”\n“Did he pay for it out of his fifty dollars?”\n“He got fifty dollars a month, clear.”\n“In other words, he got his board free?”\n“Yes Sir. I would like to qualify that by saying that that is my\nunderstanding of the situation.”\n“Was the Mandieh Settlement under any financial obliga-\ntion to the accused?”\n“No Sir.”\n“Was the Aquarian Foundation under any financial obliga-\ntion to the accused?”\n“No Sir. Nothing beyond whatever salary may have been\ndue to him at the rate of fifty dollars a month.”\n“As a matter of fact, had that salary been kept up to date by\nregular monthly payments, do you know?”\n“Yes Sir.”\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 137\nCunliffe held up the two cheques that had been submitted\nas evidence, so that Beevor-Potts could see them. He then\nshowed them to Wilson.\n“Dealing with these cheques: Exhibit One is for two thou-\nsand dollars and is marked ‘Full payment for all interest in\nA.F.’ Did he have any legal or financial interest in the Aquarian\nFoundation?”\n“None that I know of.”\n“Exhibit Two is for eight hundred dollars and is marked\n‘Payment in full for all interest in Mandieh Settlement.’ What\ndo you say to that?”\n“He had absolutely no interest in the Mandieh\nSettlement.”\nCunliffe then questioned Wilson about the conversation\nhe’d had with England when England announced his resigna-\ntion. Wilson claimed he’d never given his consent to England\nto take the money:\n“I told him he had no legal right to it. He said he had, and\nthat he was going to retain it, and that he would decide what\nhe would do with it.”\nWilson made no mention of any previous understanding\nhe might have had with England about salary, or of his con-\nversations with Lucas in the Hotel Georgia and earlier when\nEngland had been made a Governor of the Society.\nT.P. Morton cross-examined Wilson, but didn’t question him\nat any length. He asked about England’s missing diary, but\nWilson said he had no knowledge of it. Morton sat down, obvi-\nously not intending to continue. Beevor-Potts asked England\nif he had anything to say in answer to the charge.\n“I have nothing to say, Sir,” replied England.\nBeevor-Potts ordered England to stand trial at the next\ncriminal assize court in Nanaimo, to be held on November\n20. He adjourned the court.\nThe accused was led from the courtroom back to his cell.\nIf convicted at the assizes—and it appeared as if Wilson had\na strong case against him—England faced a prison sentence\n\n138 B R O T H E R X I I\nand future criminal record. It was not a pleasant prospect and\nhe realized that in the circumstances, Wilson was unlikely to\nshow any mercy in demanding that justice be served.\nr r r\nShortly before 11:00 A.M. on October 24, 1928, Maurice\nVon Platen, Robert DeLuce, and Edward Lucas entered the\nCenter Building. They were hopeful that the General Meeting\nwould be little more than a formality, and that the motion to\ndissolve the Aquarian Foundation would be quickly passed. Of\nthe original Governors of the Society, only Wilson, Lucas, Von\nPlaten, and DeLuce would be attending. Joseph Benner had\nsent his power of attorney to Von Platen; Comfort, Turnbull,\nFisher, and England had resigned. The dissenting Governors\nwere looking forward to putting the entire episode of the\nAquarian Foundation behind them.\nWhen the three entered the auditorium, they were amazed\nto see Wilson flanked by Alfred and Annie Barley and George\nand Louise Hobart. Wilson explained that he’d appointed\nthem Governors of the Foundation. This meant that he was\nassured a majority: he would have five votes to the dissenting\nGovernors’ four. Wilson called the meeting to order and an-\nnounced that in accordance with the by-laws that gave the\npresident the power to increase the number of Governors to\ntwelve, he’d appointed the Barleys and Hobarts Governors of\nthe Society. He then read from a prepared statement:\n“I am keenly sensible of the responsibility which rests upon\nthis Order to see that the monies donated to us from time to\ntime to carry on our work are properly applied for the pur-\nposes for which they were donated. It has been suggested that\nin view of the dissension which has been raised by some of\nthe Governors, this outer Order as a legal entity should be\ndissolved, but such a course would automatically involve a\ncompulsory realization of the assets and a distribution of those\nassets among those holding legal membership in the Society.\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 139\nI am impelled to the conclusion that dissolution is not, at the\npresent time, the proper remedy for whatever troubles may\nexist, and would certainly be a very unfair proceeding having\nregard to the wishes of those who have donated to this Order\nas a whole the funds and assets of which it has control.”\nDeLuce, Von Platen, and Lucas looked at each other in\nalarm—their worst fears had been realized. But Brother XII\nhad another, less obvious reason for stacking the meeting in\nhis favour. He believed that the Governors didn’t really wish\nto dissolve the Society, but intended instead to pass a motion\ndeposing him as president, so they could seize control of the\norganization themselves. His appointment of the Barleys and\nHobarts as Governors defeated this stratagem.\nBrother XII proceeded to dictate three terms which would\nhave to be complied with before he would agree to dissolve\nthe Society:\n“First, there must be refunded to the Mandieh Settlement\nFund the sum of $2,800\n, which Robert England, the erstwhile\nSecretary-Treasurer of this Order, wrongfully abstracted. It is\nmy firm conviction that his action was instigated by some of\nthe Governors, or at least is now supported by them.\n“Secondly, all attempts to depose me and obtain control of\nthe Outer Order and to obstruct our work must cease, and\nharmony must prevail.\n“Thirdly, proper arrangements must be made to safeguard\nthe monies donated or loaned to this Order, and if no other\nsolution can be arrived at, then such monies should be re-\nturned to the donors or lenders.”\nThe three dissenting Governors looked at Wilson, their faces\nset. Von Platen told him they couldn’t accept his conditions.\nWilson tabled the motion to dissolve the Society. With the\nBarleys and the Hobarts voting with him, he outvoted the\nothers five votes to four, defeating the motion. He then de-\nclared the meeting adjourned.\nThe dissenting Governors left the auditorium. Outside the\nCenter Building, they climbed into Von Platen’s car and drove\n\n140 B R O T H E R X I I\noff, leaving Wilson and the others to congratulate themselves\non their victory.\nVon Platen’s car arrived at the Nanaimo police station and\nthe three men climbed out. Inside the station, a hurried con-\nference took place as they put into effect a contingency plan\nthey had devised for just this situation. Lucas and Robert\nDeLuce put up a bond for England’s bail; England then laid\na charge of theft against Wilson, accusing him of stealing\n$13,000 from the Aquarian Foundation. England also swore\nout a warrant for Wilson’s arrest.\nWilson had left the headquarters immediately after the\nmeeting. He was driven to Nanaimo, where he boarded the\nPrincess Elaine for Vancouver. Three hours later as he stepped\noff the ferry, two officers closed in on him. They informed the\nstartled Wilson he was under arrest, then unceremoniously\nhustled him off to the police station. The details of Wilson’s\narrest no doubt pleased England. Ironically, it had taken place\nin circumstances identical to his own—a fitting case of poetic\njustice.\nThat evening, Wilson was so weak he could barely stand\nas he faced Magistrate Beevor-Potts in the dimly lit Nanaimo\npolice court. Frank Cunliffe had acted quickly for his client,\nusing $10,000 of the Hess Trust as a security deposit and ar-\nranging for Alfred Barley and George Hobart to furnish the\nbalance of Wilson’s $20,000 bond. Late that night, Wilson was\nreleased, shaken by his ordeal.\nGeorge Hobart drove the exhausted guru back to Cedar.\nSlumped in the back seat of the car, Wilson was shocked by\nthe treachery of his enemies. His arrest was proof to him that\nthey would stop at nothing to destroy him and his work. In his\nown house at last, he collapsed into bed and slept.\nThe next day, Von Platen and DeLuce met Lucas in his\noffice in the Standard Bank Building in Vancouver to discuss\nthe situation. Wilson had outmaneuvered them at the meeting\nand still retained control of the Foundation funds. They de-\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 141\ncided that their next course of action would be to apply to the\nSupreme Court of British Columbia for an injunction to re-\nstrain him from dealing with any of the funds of the Society.\nThat afternoon in the court house on Georgia Street,\nEdward Lucas presented the case for the injunction to Chief\nJustice F. B. Gregory. He explained that for some time Wilson\nhad been carrying on the affairs of the Aquarian Foundation\nagainst the wishes of the other Governors. He’d refused to dis-\nsolve the Society at a general meeting called for that purpose,\nand had seized control of the Society’s funds, amounting to\n$45,000, using them to build a separate settlement on Valdes\nIsland and for other purposes unknown to the Governors.\nLucas read from the affidavit: “The defendant, Edward\nArthur Wilson, has obtained control of the monies of the\nAquarian Foundation and is systematically and continuously\nmisapplying the same, and unless a Receiver be appointed\nand an injunction granted, all the monies of the Aquarian\nFoundation will be misapplied and totally lost.”\nAfter a brief hearing, Justice Gregory granted the injunc-\ntion. It went into effect immediately, freezing the assets of the\nSociety, including Wilson’s personal account. The injunction\nprevented him from holding any meetings of the Governors\nor from otherwise transacting any business of the Society.\nLucas rushed to telephone Nanaimo Printers. He threat-\nened the manager with dire legal penalties if he printed a\ngeneral letter that Brother XII had written to the membership,\nanswering the charges against him. Lucas so intimidated the\nmanager that he even refused to give Wilson galley proofs of\nthe letter. Wilson was thus prevented from defending himself\nor explaining his actions to the Foundation members.\nRobert England, who had been released on bail furnished\nby Lucas and DeLuce, now laid a second charge of theft against\nWilson. He charged that on October 5, 1928, Wilson had re-\nmoved $5,000 \nfrom the Aquarian Foundation bank account\nand deposited it to his own personal account. This increased\nthe amount Wilson was accused of stealing to $18,000.\n\n142 B R O T H E R X I I\nAt Cedar, Brother XII was still recuperating from his\narrest. He was confined to bed, too ill to sit up to a typewriter.\nPropped up by pillows, he wrote in longhand to Oliver Hess,\ntelling him about the recent events. He said that both Robert\nEngland and Edward Lucas had betrayed him: “Lucas, who\nalso had my confidence, as you know, has deserted me and is\nretained by the German and his money. He has advised them\nall along.”\nHe explained that the injunction prevented him from using\nany funds— even those in his own bank account—and had\nbeen deliberately timed to coincide with his arrest:\nThis was to cut me off from the possibility of bail, so that\nI would be forced into the common gaol. This they knew\nwould kill me physically as I am an invalid, and can only\nkeep my body going with the greatest care. They issued a\nsecond charge (more money), and their lawyer asked the\nmagistrate \nto increase the bail. This he refused to do: even the\nmagistrate can see it is a plain case of malicious persecu-\ntion. Then they took exception to one of the bondsmen in\nthe bail already issued in the hope that they could force me\ninto the gaol in that way. By the mercy of God and the help\nof loyal friends, that move was defeated and I came home\nlast night to go to my bed—very ill.\nBrother XII advised Hess that the securities in the Hess\nTrust which he’d donated to him personally—and not to\nthe Aquarian Foundation—had provided him with his bail\nmoney: “These are the only means I have of protection, or\nof continuing this fight to protect our Work. They have saved\nme from imprisonment and, I believe, physical death. You can\nthank God that such is the case.”\nThe next day, Wilson got up from his bed to attend two sep-\narate court cases in Nanaimo. In the morning, he appeared\nat his preliminary hearing to answer the charge of stealing\n$18,000 from the Aquarian Foundation. Standing in the dock,\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 143\nhe looked tired and drawn, and he seemed relieved when the\nhearing was adjourned for three days. It was a sorely needed\nreprieve for a man in his condition.\nIn the afternoon, Wilson testified against James Lippincott\nand a workman named Perry More. He’d brought trespassing\ncharges against the two men when they’d refused to leave the\npremises at Cedar after he’d ordered them off the property.\nThey had retaliated by bringing lawsuits of their own against\nWilson. Lippincott was suing Wilson for $450, representing\nthree months of work at the Mandieh Settlement. More had\nfiled a claim for $1,000 in unpaid wages.\nIn the trespassing case, the debate became acrimonious as\naccusations and counter-accusations flew bitterly across the\ncrowded courtroom before Magistrate C. H. Beevor-Potts.\nT. P. Morton infuriated Wilson by calling him an “upstart” and\nby saying he had no right at the Center and ought to “get off.”\nThese and other insulting statements made by Morton in front\nof the court had Wilson practically beside himself with rage.\nOver Cunliffe’s vigorous protest, the case was adjourned.\nFrom his bed that evening at Cedar, Wilson penned a fu-\nrious rebuttal to Morton’s comments. He claimed that his\nstatements were either “malicious and intentional lies calcu-\nlated to prejudice me with the court, or the man knows not\nwhat he is talking about.” He vehemently denied Morton’s\ncharge that the only money he had, had been taken from the\nAquarian Foundation:\n“In order to start the Aquarian Foundation, I had to sell my\nonly possessions in order to publish the preliminary \nMessage\nand my first small book, The Three Truths. I gave all that I had,\nabout $1,700 all told. . . I have a small income, possibly aver-\naging $50 a month, derived from royalties on the books I have\nwritten. This has paid all my personal living expenses to date,\nand I have never drawn one penny of recompense or salary\nfrom the Aquarian Foundation at any time.”\nWilson emphasized that he alone had created the Aquarian\nFoundation: “The entire Work has been planned and built up\n\n144 B R O T H E R X I I\nby myself. I have written every book, every pamphlet, and every\nInstruction printed or issued in connection with our organiza-\ntion. It is the literal truth that \nI am the Aquarian Foundation\nand it has no existence apart from myself.”\nThe dissenting Governors, on the other hand, had no pos-\nsible claim to anything in the Work: “Any ‘rights’ they may\nclaim as nominal Governors of this Society, they derive from\nmyself alone—I appointed them and made them such. In\nreturn, they are using the legal machinery of a British court\nof justice in an effort to persecute and hound to his death a\nBritish subject, a man whom they well know is innocent of the\ncharges they have brought forward.”\nWilson sank back in his bed, exhausted. He felt a sudden\npressure in his chest and had difficulty breathing. The pres-\nsure increased and he felt a shooting pain in his left arm. His\npanic mounted as he realized he was having a heart attack.\nDr. Ross Lane rushed out from Nanaimo to examine Wilson.\nHe confirmed that he’d indeed suffered a heart attack—but\na minor one, not serious enough to disable him. He ordered\nWilson to remain in bed for three days of complete rest. Help-\nless and frustrated, Wilson lay on his pillows, powerless to act\nagainst the enemies who were bent on destroying him.\nThe same day in Vancouver, Von Platen, DeLuce, and\nLucas launched another legal action against Wilson. Since\nhe had refused to dissolve the Aquarian Foundation volun-\ntarily, they attempted to force its dissolution by petitioning\nthe Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia to revoke the\nSociety’s charter.\nStanding on the front steps of the provincial court house,\nLucas told a group of reporters, “The storm about the Aquarian\nFoundation has been brewing for some time. It broke upon\nthe establishment by Mr. Wilson of the Mandieh Settlement,\nand his announcement of his views on marriage.”\nLucas briefly explained why he and his fellow Governors\nwere filing the petition. He said he felt it was important that\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 145\nthe public at large, as well as the members of the Foundation,\nbe informed of Brother XII’s activities.\nThe petition summarized the charges against Wilson in the\nmatter of the $25,000 donation by Mary Connally:\nThe said Wilson wrongfully diverted a great portion of\nthe said fund to an account in the Canadian Bank of Com-\nmerce at Nanaimo, called the Mandieh Settlement account,\nand proceeded to purchase in his own name, or jointly\nwith others unknown to the petitioners, a piece of land on\nValdes Island which was called the Mandieh Settlement,\nand to store there large quantities of food, and make other\nlarge capital expenditures from the funds belonging to the\nAquarian Foundation.\nThe Mandieh Settlement has no connection with the\nAquarian Foundation save that the said Wilson is the pro-\nprietor and owner of it.\nThe said Wilson left Cedar on a trip to the East in July,\n1928\n, and returned to the Mandieh Settlement accom-\npanied by a woman who is the wife of a professional man\nin the State of New York. The said Wilson established her\nat the said Mandieh Settlement as his mistress; and this not-\nwithstanding the fact that in the house occupied by him on\nthe property of the Aquarian Foundation was living at the\nsame time a woman who had been introduced by Wilson to\nyour petitioners as his wife.\nThe petition stated that Wilson had since been arrested\non two charges of theft of the Society’s funds: “More of the\nnefarious practices of the said Wilson will be given by your\npetitioners by way of verbal evidence as is required to establish\nthe position that it is not in the interests of decency and order\nthat the said Society should continue to exist.”\nThe petition also stated that Joseph Benner of Akron,\nOhio, had written to express his accord with the action of\nthe Governors; the petitioners therefore comprised all of the\n\n146 B R O T H E R X I I\noriginal Governors of the Society with the exception of Wilson.\nThe petition concluded by asking the Lieutenant-Governor to\ncancel the incorporation of the Aquarian Foundation and de-\nclare the Society dissolved.\nr r r\nEdward Lucas was always one to appreciate the humour in a\nsituation. Brother XII had often predicted that Armageddon\nwould occur in 1928. Lucas realized that the prophecy had\ncome true, although not in quite the way Brother XII had\nforetold:\nARMAGEDDON\n“Maurice von Platen\nWithout any excuse,\nProceeded to fatten\nWith Robert DeLuce\nThe magic Aquarian Golden-Egg Goose,\nAnd to put it to premature death!”\nThe Skipper grew wrath,\nAnd the Skipper grew stern –\n“The grim aftermath\nThey will presently learn!”\nHe added with sibilant breath.\n“Neither Robert DeLuce\nNor Maurice Von Platen,\nSo long as I’m loose,\nWill plunder or batten\n(The fire he put the traditional fat in)\nOn the riches I’ve painfully stored.\nI have plans of my own\nTo prevent them from leaking,\n\nCharges and Counter-Charges 147\nDistinctly alone\n(In a manner of speaking)\nI will handle my husbanded hoard.”\nThus did he say,\nThus did he write ‘em,\nSo to put him away\nWhere the dogs would not bite him,\nThey decided without more ado to indict him,\nAnd appealed to the nearest police.\nThus Robert DeLuce\nAnd Maurice Von Platen\nWithout parley or truce\nProceeded to flatten\nThe white-bedecked Angel of Peace.\nThey said that a Master\nOught not to fear\nFinancial disaster\nOr accumulate gear,\nOr dally with truth or act on the queer\nAnd this was the message they brought:\nWithout Sanskrit or Latin,\nBut plain as the deuce,\nMaurice Von Platen\nAnd Robert DeLuce\nSaid the Skipper’s pronouncements were rot.\nAnd the state of affairs\nAt the moment of writing\nIs that very few prayers\nAnd some fairly hot fighting\nAnd the mutual clangor of legal indicting\nVibrate the Aquarian cash.\n\n148 B R O T H E R X I I\nThus “the unification\nOf men of good will”\nSuffered inflation\nUnduly until\nIt burst with a terrible crash.\n\n149\nCHAPTER\nVI\nWeird Occultism Exemplified\nA \nblack 1928 Ford sedan motored along Holden-Corso\nRoad through the farming district of Cedar. Up and\ndown the hills it went, winding its way through leafy\ngroves of maples and sumacs ablaze in the scarlet and gold\ncolours of autumn. The cattle grazed behind split-rail fences\nand the rolling green fields were dotted with farmhouses and\nbarns. Inside the car, Nanaimo lawyer Victor B. Harrison and\nVancouver Province reporter Bruce McKelvie discussed Brother\nXII and the court cases they’d attended the day before.\nHarrison turned down a leafy road towards the sea, glinting a\nvivid blue between the trees. Following the road to its end, the\ncar came to a stop in front of the massive wooden gates of the\nAquarian Foundation.\nThe two men stepped out of the car. Harrison, a power-\nful and heavyset man with a large nose and strong\nfeatures, was a prominent figure in Nanaimo; he’d been\nelected mayor several times and was a partner in Harrison\n\n150 B R O T H E R X I I\nand McIntyre, one of the town’s leading law firms. He was also\nrelated to the former president of the United States, William\nHenry Harrison. His companion, Bruce McKelvie, was a robust\nindividual with a ruddy complexion. He wore thick spectacles\nand resembled Dickens’s famous character Mr. Pickwick. A\nveteran reporter with \nThe Vancouver Province, McKelvie had\nbeen covering the legislature in Victoria when he’d been as-\nsigned the story about the Foundation. He stepped forward\nand rattled the nine-foot gates while Harrison stood back,\nthumbs hooked in his vest. On the other side of the stout wire\nfence, they could see the houses nestled among the trees—\nan idyllic scene this quiet Saturday morning. Seeing no one\nabout, McKelvie called out to attract attention.\nMoments later, a dignified elderly gentleman emerged from\none of the houses and approached the gates. George Hobart\ngreeted the two strangers in a friendly manner. Harrison and\nMcKelvie introduced themselves and asked if he could give\nthem some information about the Aquarian Foundation.\nBrother XII was in bed that morning, still recuperating from\nhis heart attack. Had he known about the visitors, one may\nbe certain he would never have admitted them or allowed\nanyone to speak with them. But Hobart was open and trusting.\nUnlocking the gates, he let the two men inside and offered to\ngive them a tour of the premises.\nHobart showed Harrison and McKelvie around the prop-\nerty, letting them view the fine houses with their handsome\nworkmanship, the communal dining-room and cookhouse,\nthe power plant, the garages and vegetable gardens, and the\n“Pepper Pot”—a quaint little cabin that different members\nused as a writing studio. Inside the Center Building, he intro-\nduced them to a young Scotsman named Herbert Cameron,\nwhom Brother XII had recently hired as a bookkeeper to\nreplace England. The two men inspected the offices and work-\nrooms, including the auditorium with its polished hardwood\nfloor and raised platform from which Brother XII addressed\nhis followers.\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 151\nLeaving the Center Building, they walked down to the water-\nfront, where they met Perry More and James Lippincott. The\ntwo Americans were sharing a small cabin, refusing to leave\nthe property until their trespassing case was settled. A cement\ncontractor from Los Angeles and a nonstop talker, More\nenthusiastically expounded on the Aquarian Foundation phi-\nlosophy. Lippincott showed McKelvie his chart, “Astrology is\nthe Clock of Destiny,” which was advertised in The Chalice, and\nexplained the astrological significance of the teachings. In\nanswer to McKelvie’s questions, Hobart outlined the reasons\nfor the split between Brother XII and the other Governors. He\ndiscussed the dispute over the new settlement on Valdes, and\nspoke candidly about the scandal that had erupted around\nBrother XII’s relationship with the so-called “Magdalene\nfrom Chicago.” McKelvie and Harrison listened with intense\ninterest.\nHobart even led the visitors past the tangled blackberry\nbushes and down the path to the ravine where the House\nof Mystery stood masked in a clump of trees. He explained\nthat in this cabin, Brother XII would leave his body and while\nin the state of \nsamadhi, communicate with the Masters of\nWisdom and receive instructions for the Work. Hobart added\nthat other members had also achieved samadhi, and that it\nwasn’t necessary to have a retreat for the purpose.\nThe group returned to the Center Building. McKelvie\nasked the disciples there how they regarded Brother XII now.\nSeveral remarked that they’d observed a change in him. “He\nis not like the man I knew in California at all,” said one. “A\nfriend of mine saw him there when he was in \nsamadhi for six\ndays, and his face was wonderfully beautiful. He is different\nnow.”\nAlthough one section of the Foundation was trying to put\nBrother XII behind bars, most members viewed him more in\nsorrow than in anger. It wasn’t really his fault, one of the disci-\nples explained: “He took the ‘Sixth Initiation,’ and he should\nnot have done it. He failed the test, and his Black Adept is the\n\n152 B R O T H E R X I I\ncause of it.”\nWhat did a Black Adept have to do with it? asked McKelvie.\nThe disciples informed him that on the higher planes to\nwhich a spirit could project itself, there were Black Adepts or\ninfluences—what the orthodox mind would call devils. One\nof these adepts had taken possession of Brother XII, and it\nwasn’t “The Brother” that the fuss was about, but his black\nfamiliar.\n“I have seen the Black Adept,” whispered one of the disci-\nples. “And so did another member of the Foundation. We\nboth saw him—the other man saw him twice—and we com-\npared notes. It was the same one all right. He wore a black\ncowl that came down to his shoulders and his face was like\nleather that had been smoked for a month.”\nThe visit ended, and Hobart escorted Harrison and Mc-\nKelvie back to the gate. Before he said goodbye, he gave them\nseveral of Brother XII’s books and some copies of \nThe Chalice.\nThe two men thanked him and drove off. McKelvie was de-\nlighted by their good fortune—they’d succeeded in getting\nan inside look at the Foundation and he had everything he\nneeded for his story about Brother XII.\nr r r\nBruce McKelvie began his newspaper career as a schoolboy\nselling rags to The Province to clean the printing presses—when\nsupplies ran short, the ladies of the neighbourhood wondered\nwhy their laundry kept mysteriously disappearing from their\nclotheslines! As a youth, McKelvie worked as a “printer’s devil”\non Texada Island, feeding paper into a flatbed press, but when\nthe family returned to Vancouver, he got a job working for \nThe\nProvince \non the police beat. It was the days when reporters\nwere issued guns and rode in squad cars, and McKelvie made\nhis reputation as a crime reporter of legendary skill. During\nhis career, he’d covered every major story in the province,\nfrom murders to mine disasters, and he was on a first-name\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 153\nbasis with premiers, police chiefs, and underworld figures.\nHe was also an expert on Native Indian culture, having been\nmade a blood brother of the Sliammon tribe after saving the\nChief’s daughter from drowning. His novel \nHuldowget vividly\nportrayed Indian customs and magic; he’d also written a boys’\nadventure novel, \nBlack Canyon, based on an Indian massacre\nof gold miners in the Fraser Canyon in 1858, as well as a book\non the early history of British Columbia. McKelvie brought his\nconsiderable talents as a reporter to the Brother XII story, so\nmuch so that he himself would become an important figure\nin the drama.\nThat night, McKelvie typed up his article about the Aquarian\nFoundation for The Province’s Sunday edition. When he’d\nfinished, he wrote to his friend Harry Pooley, the Attorney-\nGeneral of British Columbia, telling him about the colony at\nCedar and joking that there were some aspects to the story\n“that even my ingenuity could not manage to put into a family\njournal.” It hadn’t taken McKelvie long to make up his mind\nabout the Foundation. He informed Pooley:\nIt is nothing more or less than a free-love colony, and\nthe resort of weak-minded, money-mad Americans who\nhave been resorting there by the hundreds. If not checked,\nI am sure that British Columbia is going to be put to the\nexpense of maintaining a number of them at Essondale\n[the provincial mental hospital]. In fact, one young fellow\nnamed Fisher went raving mad in Nanaimo a few days ago\nand was sent to an asylum. This fellow invested anywhere\nfrom $15,000 to $20,000 in the erection of a magnificent\nhouse in the colony with its own electric light system, etc.\nA German-American millionaire named Von Platen is an-\nother who has a home there that cost many thousands.\nThere are about twenty persons at the colony now, but\nduring the summer months, they numbered hundreds.\nThe manager of the Malaspina Hotel told me that he was\ncrowded with them, mostly wealthy men and women from\n\n154 B R O T H E R X I I\nCalifornia, who went out there daily to imbibe the wisdom\nof Brother XII, and swallow his doctrines, hook, line, and\nsinker.\nThe teachings seem to be a jumble of all the occult doc-\ntrines from ancient Egypt to the present day, with special\ninstructions from “The Master Minds” given to Wilson while\nhe is “samadhi” or in a trance.\nMcKelvie quoted an excerpt from Brother XII’s article on\nmarriage, saying it was “too hot for the sedate columns of \nThe\nProvince, \nso I’m giving it to you to show the real trend of affairs\nthere.” He told Pooley that marriage laws and conventions\nwere derided, and that Brother XII was carrying on an affair\nwith a married woman, even though he had a wife living at the\nheadquarters at Cedar.\n“This new love-nest on Valdes Island, as well as money,\nseems to be at the bottom of the court charges and counter\ncharges that are to be heard Tuesday. . . To me, it looks as if\nit might develop into another Aimee Semple McPherson case\non a larger scale, AND WE DON’T WANT THAT IN B.C.”\nMcKelvie urged Pooley to launch an official investigation\ninto Brother XII’s activities: “I hope you take some action to\npreserve decency in our regard for morality. As a father of a\ngrowing family, as well as a citizen of British Columbia, I don’t\nwant to see that kind of a cult grow up here.”\nOn Sunday, October 28, McKelvie’s story appeared on\nthe front page of \nThe Province under the headline: WEIRD\nOCCULTISM EXEMPLIFIED IN AMAZING COLONY AT\nCEDAR-BY-SEA.\nRevelations Follow Dissension in Cult of Aquarian\nFoundation, Which Has Been Flourishing in Pretty\nVancouver Island Village—Chief “Master of Wisdom”\nPrefers Trespassing Charge Against Former Disciples of\nPeculiar Order—“House of Mystery” Amid Mansions of\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 155\nWealthy Adherents, All Enclosed by Barbed Wire Fence.\nRevelations that will startle the public are promised when\nthe charges and counter-charges that have split the Aquarian\nFoundation at Cedar wide open are aired in court here next\nweek. Weird occult doctrines suggestive of the teachings of\nBuddha and half a score of other theosophical and astro-\nlogical teachers from Zoroaster to Madame Blavatsky, with\nnew and incomprehensible additions claimed to be recent\npersonal instructions from some “Master” will be unfolded.\nMingling of the sexes under plea of spiritual duty and in\ndefiance of recognized marriage laws will be told, for it was\nupon this doctrine of freedom, agreed to in theory, but\nobjected to in practice, that the Aquarian movement has\napparently crashed.\nMcKelvie gave an account of his visit to the Foundation\nheadquarters, and said it was a mystery “how a retired sea-cap-\ntain managed in this age and generation to gather about him\nfrom the four corners of the continent and Europe a following\nof apparently intelligent men and women who accepted him\nas a superior being in personal contact with ‘The Masters’ on\nspiritual planes far removed from this mundane sphere.” He\ndescribed Wilson as “a spare, slightly stoop-shouldered, pale-\nfaced and ascetic-looking man, who sports a thick square-cut\ngreying beard,” and stated that the cult had approximately two\nthousand members throughout the United States and Canada.\nWilson’s antagonist, Robert England, was a “clean-shaven,\nsunburned young man in his thirties. . . He is a prepossessing\nchap with more than the average share of good looks.”\nMcKelvie quoted at length from Brother XII’s articles in\nThe Chalice, including his attack upon marriage: “‘The idea\nthat participation in such a ceremony (a recognized marriage\nceremony) confers exclusive and possessive rights over the\nperson and affections of another can never be substantiated.\nIt cannot be so because it is not in accord with the facts; if it\nis backed by a man-made law, the law will not prevail because\n\n156 B R O T H E R X I I\nit is at variance with the laws of Nature.’” McKelvie reported\nthat members of the Foundation had predicted sensations\nwhen the court cases opened. He concluded his article by\ncalling for an immediate government investigation into the\nactivities of the colony: “There is a strong feeling in Nanaimo\nthat enough has already been revealed to warrant prompt and\nspeedy action by the Attorney-General to find out what kind\nof a cult has been established in British Columbia.”\nMcKelvie’s story was picked up by the Hearst newspaper\nchain and appeared all across the United States. It made\nthe front pages of \nThe San Francisco Examiner and The Los\nAngeles Examiner, headlined: FREE LOVE CULT LAID TO\nCALIFORNIANS and CALIFORNIAN CALLED HEAD OF\nLOVE CULT. The Hearst story identified Brother XII as a\nformer resident of California and Spain, and claimed that\nmany Californians were included among his disciples:\nCloistered in a sylvan Eden among remote forests of\nVancouver Island, far from plebian eyes, is a magnificent\nretreat where wealthy Americans, particularly from Cali-\nfornia, are wont to retire to study “occult mysticisms.”\nBut Canadian authorities, called upon to settle a rather\nworldly dispute among denizens of this synthetic paradise,\nhave scratched beneath its esthetic exterior. And their offi-\ncial delving is said to have revealed, under the surface of its\nneo-mystic labels, a startlingly elaborate “free love” colony.\nThe Nanaimo newspapers eagerly seized upon the story. \nThe\nDaily Herald informed its readers that the members of the new\nreligious sect sequestering itself in the leafy, almost impene-\ntrable seclusion of Cedar believed that the world was going\nto the “demnition bow-wows,” and that after the cataclysm,\nthe Aquarians would take charge of the earth. The writer ridi-\nculed Brother XII’s pretensions: “President Wilson is one of\nthe Twelve Masters of Wisdom. Who the other eleven are does\nnot matter, for the whole idea is absolutely ridiculous.” He\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 157\nsaid it was impossible to define occultism (“They [sic] are no\nwords to explain those things what [sic] cannot be grasped, or\nwhich do not register in the mind. . .”), but said it was good\nenough to “cheat and cozen some of Barnum’s daily arrivals\nout of their wits, their minds, and their earthly possessions.”\nHe demanded that the Aquarian Foundation be investigated,\ndeported from Vancouver Island, and “stamped out.”\nBruce McKelvie remained in Nanaimo, waiting for Wilson’s\npreliminary hearing. While he was there, he interviewed the\nlocal people to get their reaction to the startling developments\nof the past week. The following day, his story appeared on the\nfront page of \nThe Province:\nCULT’S REVOLT EYE-OPENER TO OLD NANAIMO.\nPeople of Island City Thought at First That Aquarian Foun-\ndation Had Something to Do with Fish, But Now They\nKnow Otherwise, and the Happenings at Cedar-by-the-Sea\nFurnish Biggest Sensation in Years.\nCitizens of Nanaimo are watching with keen interest the\nstruggle that has centered about the Aquarian Foundation\nby the seashore and in the maple groves of Cedar district,\nwhich is reflected in charges and counter-charges in the\ncourts of British Columbia. In the seventy-five years since\nthe coal mines of Nanaimo were opened, there have been\nmany sensations and excitements in the Coal Capital of the\nPacific Coast—but this war among the devotees of a new\ncult is something novel and entertaining, and its progress is\nbeing observed with attention. The whole thing is so unex-\npected and surprising that the good people of Nanaimo do\nnot quite know what to make of it.\nMcKelvie reported that the colonists had previously been\nregarded by their neighbours as a harmless lot of faddists who\nwere good spenders at the local stores. They had referred to\nthem as “the Aquariums” and had left them alone, not prying\ninto their affairs. Now, however, they felt a new and justifiable\n\n158 B R O T H E R X I I\ncuriosity: “‘I thought,’ observed one old resident of the district\nas he lighted his pipe, ‘that they had something to do with fish.\nYou see, on the other side of the town, at Departure Bay, the\ngovernment has a place—a biological station it is called—and\nI’ve heard some call it an aquarium. Well, naturally, I thought\nthat this bunch at Cedar was another outfit like that, only run\nby rich Americans who made a hobby of studying fish life.’\n“But,” continued McKelvie, “the good people of Nanaimo\nare learning a great deal, and the new importance of the place\nis a subject of general discussion.\n“When one man who had read some of the Aquarian litera-\nture told his friend that the selection of Cedar as the home\nof the cult had been dictated by a higher authority on an ad-\nvanced plane, the answer was given: ‘Well, can you blame the\nSpirit? Ain’t this district the finest in the world?’”\nWhile interviewing people in Nanaimo, McKelvie met a\nman who claimed to have known Wilson thirty years earlier.\nHe told McKelvie that he’d encountered Wilson on the street\nonly a few days ago and had greeted him by name. Wilson\nhad looked at him blankly. The following exchange had taken\nplace:\n“Don’t you know me?” the man asked.\n“No,” replied Wilson. “I never saw you before.”\n“Oh yes, you did. You recall when we worked together for\nthe Dominion Express in Victoria.”\n“I never worked for the Dominion Express,” Wilson\nanswered.\nAt this, the man became somewhat annoyed, since he was\ncertain Wilson had recognized him.\n“You did work for the Dominion Express,” he continued,\n“not only at Victoria, but also at Calgary. We roomed in the\nsame house in Calgary. At Victoria, you asked for an in-\ncrease in wages and when you were refused, you quit and\nwent to sea. You remember me all right!”\nWilson was nonplussed for a moment; then, seeing it\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 159\nwas useless to further deny his identity, replied: “Yes, I re-\nmember; but for God’s sake, don’t say anything about it.”\nMcKelvie had every reason to believe the man’s story,\nsince he was still smarting from Wilson’s rebuff. He also told\nMcKelvie that Wilson was fond of the sea and had owned a\nsmall sailboat in which he had explored the coastal waters off\nVancouver Island. He was therefore well acquainted with the\nlocality. McKelvie was puzzled: Why would Wilson wish to con-\nceal the fact that he’d lived in British Columbia before?\nMcKelvie then recalled a statement Wilson had made in a\nletter written from Southampton, England, on January 15,\n1927, and reprinted in the booklet, \nThe Aquarian Foundation:\nA Movement for the Unification of all Men of Good Will. Announ-\ncing the location of the colony in North America, he had\ninformed his disciples:\n“The Center chosen by the Manu (Vaivasata) to be the cradle\nof the coming sixth sub-race is neither Mexico nor California,\nbut Southern British Columbia. . . This locality has been actually\nand definitely selected—it is his choice alone, and while it is\nalready known to me, \nI have not seen it in the physical body as\nyet.” [McKelvie’s italics]\nMcKelvie couldn’t reconcile the statement in the letter with\nthe story the former express clerk had told him. He concluded\nthat Wilson had lied in the letter and that many sincere people\nwere being deceived by him. McKelvie decided to investigate\nWilson’s past. In the meantime, he was certain of one thing—\nBrother XII’s claim to have never been in southern British\nColumbia in the physical body was “poppycock.”\nr r r\nOn Tuesday, October 30, 1928, Wilson’s preliminary\nhearing was held. By ten o’clock, every seat was taken as\ncurious spectators jammed the courtroom seeking a glimpse of\nthe mysterious cult leader. McKelvie was covering the hearing\n\n160 B R O T H E R X I I\nfor The Province, and Victor B. Harrison was watching the pro-\nceedings on behalf of the Attorney-General’s office.\nMagistrate C.H. Beevor-Potts brought the court to order\nwith a sharp rap of his gavel. T.P. Morton acted for the prosecu-\ntion and Frank Cunliffe represented the accused. Beevor-Potts\nread the charge that Wilson “on or about August 28th in the\nsaid county of Nanaimo unlawfully did steal $13,000, the prop-\nerty of the Aquarian Foundation.”\nCunliffe wanted the second charge of theft of $5,000 to be\nheard at the same time. Morton insisted they be tried sepa-\nrately. “But they are bound up together,” protested Cunliffe.\nBeevor-Potts convinced Morton that the evidence given in the\n$13,000 charge should apply to the second charge as well.\nRobert England took the stand and was sworn in. In answer\nto Morton’s questions, the former secretary-treasurer de-\nscribed the circumstances surrounding Mary Connally’s\n$23,000 donation. He explained that Wilson had given him\nthe bank draft on Valdes Island.\n“The draft was taken to the bank under instructions from\nMr. Wilson?” asked Morton.\n“Yes. He wrote on the back of the envelope what to do with it.”\nEngland stated that he’d deposited the cheque in the Cana-\ndian Bank of Commerce in Nanaimo, dividing it three ways:\n$10,000 into the account of the Aquarian Foundation; $8,000\ninto the account of the Mandieh Settlement Fund; and $5,000\ninto Wilson’s own personal account. The entire $23,000\nshould have been deposited to the account of the Aquarian\nFoundation, he said, since it had been given to further the\nwork of the Society.\nMorton’s strategy was to show that Wilson was using the\nfunds for purposes other than the declared objects of the\nFoundation. Leaning towards England, he asked him about\nthe property on Valdes:\n“This land that was purchased on Valdes Island, in whose\nname was it purchased?”\n“The actual deed was made out in the name of Mr. Wilson,\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 161\nand not in the name of the Aquarian Foundation.”\n“What did he build there?”\n“The first thing he built there was a log cabin.”\n“Was it a large building?”\n“The actual body of the cabin was about eighteen feet\ninside.”\n“Is it furnished?”\n“Yes Sir.”\n“How many rooms?”\n“Two.”\n“What are they used as?”\n“General living room and a bedroom.”\n“What furniture is in the bedroom?”\n“Two or three chairs, cooking utensils, dishes, and one bed\nabout three-quarter size.”\n“Did Mr. Wilson live there?”\n“Sometimes.”\n“Did he live there alone?”\n“Not all the time.”\n“Who was living there with him?”\nFrank Cunliffe sprang to his feet: “I object that this is not\nrelevant to the case.”\nThe bald, round-faced Morton shook his robes indig-\nnantly and drew himself up to his full height to address\nBeevor-Potts:\n“I wish to show that in no way can it be shown that the\nmonies that Wilson was spending on that island were being\nspent for the benefit of the Aquarian Foundation. I say that\nWilson was using that island for his own purposes and not for\nthe purposes of the Aquarian Foundation—and that those\npurposes were immoral purposes!”\nBeevor-Potts shook his head: “I am going to rule that out.\nIt is doubtless very sensational and would make good copy for\nthe newspapers, but I cannot see that it has anything to do\nwith this case at all.”\nMorton appealed to Beevor-Potts: “I have no idea of pro-\n\n162 B R O T H E R X I I\nviding sensational news, but at the same time I wished to\nendeavour to show that Wilson was using the monies of\nthe Aquarian Foundation absolutely and solely for his own\npurposes.”\n“I rule it out,” Beevor-Potts snapped.\nMorton was determined to bring out Wilson’s affair with\nMyrtle Baumgartner one way or another. He asked the Mag-\nistrate for permission to question the witness about a certain\nconversation he’d had with Wilson on Valdes Island. It had a\nbearing on the money stolen, he explained; if the prosecu-\ntion could show that Wilson had used the money for purposes\nother than those of the Aquarian Foundation, then the evi-\ndence should be admissible. Beevor-Potts allowed Morton to\nproceed.\n“What were the details of the conversation?” Morton asked\nEngland.\n“Well, he stated that he had, on one occasion, on a trip to\nChicago from Seattle—”\n“I object to that!” Cunliffe interjected. “What can that have\nto do with Valdes Island?”\nBeevor-Potts overruled the objection. He gestured towards\nEngland:\n“Proceed, witness.”\n“He told me that when travelling from Seattle to Chicago,\nhe had met a woman and that they had been together, and that\nthey had both taken the ‘Sixth Initiation.’ He said that he him-\nself was the reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian god named\nOsiris. The woman was the reincarnation of the goddess Isis.\nThere had been a conception, and a son would be born to\nthem who would be the reincarnation of Horus. The object\nof this settlement on Valdes Island was that as the result of the\nunion between the reincarnation of Osiris and Isis, they would\nbring into the world a son who would be the reincarnation of\nHorus, who in the year 1975 would be a world leader.”\nThere was dead silence in court. Morton smiled in triumph.\nEngland added that Wilson had told him he planned to bring\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 163\na woman to Valdes to rear the child.\n“I object that this has nothing to do with this alleged theft,”\nCunliffe interjected.\nBeevor-Potts sustained the objection. He agreed with\nCunliffe that the testimony shouldn’t have been allowed as it\nhad nothing to do with the charge.\nCunliffe approached the witness box to cross-examine\nEngland.\n“Where did you get the idea that this money belonged to\nthe Aquarian Foundation?”\n“Because it was sent to the Aquarian Foundation.”\n“Is that the only reason you thought it belonged to the\nAquarian Foundation?”\n“I have always understood that money so forwarded\nbelonged to the person or corporation to whom it was\naddressed.”\n“So because it was addressed to the Aquarian Foundation,\nyou say it belonged to the Aquarian Foundation?”\n“No, there were other reasons.”\n“Did you report to your fellow Governors the way in which\nthis twenty-three thousand dollars was handled?”\n“No Sir, I did not.”\n“You said nothing to any of them?”\n“I had instructions from Mr. Wilson to say nothing about it\nto anyone.”\n“Did you have any other instructions from Mr. Wilson?”\n“I had all kinds of instructions from him. I was under orders\nfrom Mr. Wilson all the time.”\n“Did you consider that he was doing right or wrong?”\n“I thought that he was doing wrong.”\n“In that case, why did you not refuse to carry out his\ninstructions?”\n“You don’t know Edward Arthur Wilson like we do. He is\na man who will not tolerate any opposition to his slightest\nwhim.”\n“Who is the owner of the Mandieh Settlement Fund?”\n\n164 B R O T H E R X I I\n“Mr. Wilson claims to be.”\n“Who was the owner of the money in the Mandieh Settle-\nment Fund?”\n“I considered it belonged to the Aquarian Foundation ever\nsince the day it was created. I always understood in my mind\nthat it belonged to the Aquarian Foundation.”\n“Why was this ten thousand dollars put into the account of\nthe Aquarian Foundation?”\n“I don’t just remember why.”\n“I suggest to you that it was to be considered as a loan?”\n“He said that to me afterwards.”\n“How long afterwards?”\n“I think within a day or so after the visit of myself and Mr.\nWilson to Vancouver.”\n“Was there any document drawn up with reference to that\nten thousand dollars, showing that it was intended to be a\nloan?”\n“Not that I can remember.”\nCunliffe held up a receipt to the court. He showed it to\nEngland.\n“Is this your writing and signature?”\n“Yes Sir.”\nCunliffe read the receipt aloud: “‘Received from E.A. Wilson\n(The Brother XII) the sum of ten thousand dollars exactly, as\na temporary loan to the Aquarian Foundation, to be repaid\nwithout interest upon demand of the said E. A. Wilson, the\nsum being from funds advanced to him by Mary Connally.’”\nThe receipt was dated August 28, 1928, and was signed by\nEngland.\n“Do you remember that now?”\n“I do. Yes Sir.”\nCunliffe moved towards England, speaking louder and\nmore forcefully.\n“What did you do with this document after you drew it\nup?”\n“I think it was in the files in the desk in the ordinary way.”\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 165\n“How often do you clean out the wastepaper basket?”\n“I never clean it out myself.”\n“Who did clean it out?”\n“Mr. Davenport.”\n“How often?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“And I suppose you cannot account for the fact that that re-\nceipt was found in the wastepaper basket all screwed up into\na ball?”\n“No Sir.”\nThere was silence in the courtroom. Cunliffe paused before\ntaking careful aim with his next question.\n“In view of that receipt, you could not seriously lay a charge\nof theft, could you?”\n“Yes, because I was instructed by Mr. Wilson to write that\nreceipt.”\n“And you did not tell any of the Governors?”\n“No Sir. I was acting under his instructions.”\n“And you took no steps whatever until after you had been\narrested on a charge of stealing $2,800?”\n“No, I did not.”\nCunliffe produced a resolution from the Governors of the\nAquarian Foundation to the Canadian Bank of Commerce\nauthorizing the opening of a new account, the Mandieh\nSettlement Fund. The resolution was signed by Wilson and\nEngland.\n“If this was not authorized by the Governors, why did you\nsign it?”\n“It was Mr. Wilson’s instructions.”\n“Did Mr. Wilson instruct you to sign false documents?”\n“Not in so many words.”\nT.P. Morton called Edward Lucas to the stand. Lucas ex-\nplained that there had been no meetings of the Governors\nduring 1928 and that no bank resolutions had been passed:\n“The Governors of the Aquarian Foundation have certainly at\nno time authorized the creation of the Mandieh Settlement or\n\n166 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe Mandieh Settlement Fund, or any diversion of the funds\nof the Aquarian Foundation to the Mandieh Settlement, the\nMandieh Settlement Fund, or to Mr. Wilson personally.”\nCunliffe cross-examined Lucas. He showed him the affidavit\nwhich Wilson had received from Mary Connally, giving him ju-\nrisdiction over her twenty-five thousand dollar donation. He\nthen read it aloud to the court:\n“In view of the fact that an attempt is now being made\nby certain persons to gain control of the Aquarian Founda-\ntion, to depose its founder and to attach its funds. . . in\nthe matter of my personal donation of twenty-five thousand\ndollars, I, \nas donor, declare that it is at the sole disposal of\nThe Brother XII (E. A. Wilson) in whole or in part, and that\nI hold him and no other responsible for its disposition and\nadministration. . . The sum of ten thousand dollars which he\nadvanced to the Aquarian Foundation for the furtherance\nof that section of his work may, at his discretion, be recalled\nand otherwise applied. . . It is my purpose and intent that\nthe full amount of my donation be held personally by The\nBrother XII (E. A. Wilson), and that without his consent, no\nother person or persons, or any organization whatsoever,\nshall participate in it.”\nMary’s statement was unequivocal. Beevor-Potts turned\nto Lucas, puzzled: “Is this not a question of a difference of\nopinion between two factions as to which of the two should\ncontrol the funds? Is this not a simple question between the\nmembers?”\nLucas insisted it was not: “As a member of the Order, I\nwould say that a sum of money having been received by the\nAquarian Foundation could not have been diverted to any\nother account without authority—without a theft being com-\nmitted. The question is whether the money has been stolen or\nwhether it has not. The accounts are simple enough.”\n“Is it not purely a civil matter?”\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 167\n“No Sir, I should say not. I think it was purely criminal. I\nshould say that nobody on earth, outside the Aquarian Foun-\ndation, could do anything with that money. Not even the\ndonor.”\nBeevor-Potts looked dubious.\nLucas gamely continued: “The fact was that the Aquarian\nFoundation received twenty-three thousand dollars from\nMrs. Connally, and that twenty-three thousand dollars went\ninto E. A. Wilson’s pocket. It is either theft or it is something\nincomprehensible.”\nT.P. Morton summed up the case for the prosecution. He\nstated that he had argued the main point: he had demonstrated\nthat Wilson had used the funds of the Aquarian Foundation\nfor purposes other than those for which they were intended.\nHe asked Beevor-Potts to commit England for trial at the fall\nassizes.\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and Frank Cunliffe asked\nfor an adjournment. He told the magistrate that the defence\nneeded until Thursday morning to prepare its case. Over\nMorton’s objections, Beevor-Potts granted the adjournment.\nThe magistrate asked the accused if he wished to say any-\nthing in answer to the charge. Wilson appeared startled by\nthe question. He slowly stood and faced Beevor-Potts. Pale\nand thin, he made as if to speak—but did not answer. Frank\nCunliffe quickly replied for him: “He has nothing to say at\npresent.”\nr r r\nBruce McKelvie’s account of Wilson’s preliminary hearing\nappeared on the front page of The Province the next day,\nheadlined: “OSIRIS AND ISIS MET ON TRAIN BETWEEN\nSEATTLE AND CHICAGO. They Were Brother XII and Lady\nFriend Reincarnated, Says Witness at Aquarian Proceedings—\nNew Messiah Was to Come Out of Valdes Island by 1975,\nAccording to Plan—Weird Story Told at Police Court Hearing\n\n168 B R O T H E R X I I\nof Cult Troubles at Cedar-by-the-Sea.”\nMcKelvie added his own touch of colour to the story, saying\nthat the romance between the two reincarnated Egyptian di-\nvinities “linked the sunny sands of ancient Egypt and the blue\nwaters of the Nile with the wooded slopes of Valdes Island and\nthe dancing waves of the Strait of Georgia.” He described the\nlove affair between the two soul mates as “the twentieth-cen-\ntury version of the love story of the gods,” and marvelled that a\nlittle two-room log cabin on Valdes Island was to be the home\nof the reincarnation of Horus, a future world leader and great\nreligious teacher like Christ.\nThese latest disclosures about the preference of the Egyptian\ndivinities for the pleasant shores of the Gulf Islands astonished\nthe local residents and inspired even more comment and\nspeculation. According to McKelvie, however, old-timers in\nthe district accepted the news philosophically. As one elderly\nresident sagely observed: “Ah, think, as ‘ow yon lad Wilson got\n‘is wires twisted, like, an’ instead o’ gettin’ ‘old o’ Mrs. Hises,\nthe gypsy goddess, ‘e got ol’ Mother Eve ‘erself.”\nNot everyone in Nanaimo approved of all the publicity the\ncase was getting. The editor of \nThe Nanaimo Free Press com-\nmented: “We are indebted to B.A. McKelvie for the assurance\nthat the affair is a local sensation, and this looks like a dirty\ncrack at our rustic emotions. Importance is only relative, and\nas no local person seems to be adversely affected by the oper-\nations of the practical occultists, I suggest the scene of court\nactivities be moved to Vancouver, which has had no sensations\nsince good civic government was established there.”\nBut Bruce McKelvie wasn’t interested only in the sensa-\ntional aspects of the story. He wanted to find out the truth\nabout Brother XII, so he set to work to learn all he could\nabout his past. In Victoria, McKelvie confirmed that Wilson\nhad, in fact, worked for the Dominion Express company as\na baggage clerk and also as the driver of a delivery wagon.\nA fellow employee remembered him as a dapper man with\na sallow complexion who often wore a red rose in his lapel.\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 169\nWilson had handled the important Wells Fargo account, but\nquit when he was refused a two-dollar-a-week raise in pay. Then\nhe’d worked for a time on a coastal steamer running between\nVictoria and San Francisco. Next, he’d tried ranching in the\nOkanagan, but when that venture was unsuccessful, he’d re-\nturned to Victoria and worked for the express company at the\nEdgewood Station. In 1912, Wilson had left Victoria on a ship\nbound for the Orient. From time to time he’d returned: once,\nit was as the first officer of a passenger ship; another time, it\nwas to try to persuade a former fellow clerk to join him in a\nSouth Seas trading venture; still later, it was to enlist support\nfor the establishment of a ship chandlery. On the basis of his\ninvestigations, McKelvie concluded that Wilson had an inti-\nmate knowledge of British Columbia. Convinced that he was\nmisrepresenting himself to his followers, he decided to do ev-\nerything he could to unmask him.\nIn Nanaimo, Brother XII was suddenly the object of intense\ninterest and curiosity. Many of the stories told about him cor-\nroborated McKelvie’s findings about Wilson’s past, since a\nnumber of local people claimed to have a vivid recollection of\nWilson as a young man.\nAlva Shaw’s father owned the IXL Stables on Skinner Street.\nAccording to her, Wilson had worked at the stables years ear-\nlier, and had made an extraordinary impression upon her\nfather and the people of Nanaimo.\n“He could hypnotize you as quick as look at you!” she re-\ncalls. “I was afraid to look at him; there was something about\nhis eyes that scared me. The horses would kick with everyone\nelse but him—he’d calm them down like magic. My dad would\nsay, ‘I think he hypnotizes the goddamned horses!’”\nAlva claims that Wilson even put on a stage show as a hyp-\nnotist in the local Orpheum. “The theatre was packed,” she\nreminisces. “All the miners wanted to see it. \nOh, he was good!\nHe went down into the audience and picked out the people\nhe wanted, then brought them up on stage. One man bet him\n\n170 B R O T H E R X I I\na dollar he couldn’t hypnotize him—he lost his bet! The girl\nplayed the piano and everyone sang. Then he’d bring them\nout of it and they wouldn’t know they’d sung. They told him\nhe was a damned liar! Some of them got mad and said they\ndidn’t sing. The audience all clapped and said, ‘Yes, you did!\nYes, you did!’\n“There were these two fellows who worked in the stables—\nClaude Peck and his brother. They were darn good workers,\nbut oh! they used to drink—they used to drink cruel! He said\nto my dad: ‘You watch, I’m going to stop them!’ My dad said,\n‘The Pecks have drunk for years; you’ll never stop them.’ And\nby God, he stopped them! And I don’t know to this day how he\nstopped them, but he did! Them fellows turned out to be won-\nderful fellows. My dad said he didn’t hypnotize them either;\nhe could tell by their eyes. It was the power he had—my dad\nsaid he had a lot of power.\n“He preached in the church too, if the minister was sick.\nHe preached as good as any minister—he didn’t even need a\nBible. He could speak three or four different languages. He\ncould talk Chinese. He talked to the Chinaman that used to\nrun the laundry. Oh, he amazed my dad something terrible!\nHe was thunderstruck to think he was so clever! He was \nso\ninterested in him. Later on, he went out to Cedar to see him,\nand when he came back he said, ‘ Yes, it’s him!’”\nMervyn Wilkinson’s father worked as a locomotive engineer\nat the Number One mine in Nanaimo. “Wilson was the lamp-\nkeeper in the mine,” Wilkinson recalls. “He had a little cabin\nnext to the pit-head. All the lamps that went down into that\nmine were inspected by him. His job was to make sure they\nwere working properly and had enough fuel. He apparently\nworked quickly and efficiently and had plenty of time to read.\nHis cabin was always stocked with the best of books.”\nA music teacher in Nanaimo named Peggy Reynolds\nboarded Wilson briefly in the spring of 1927, while he was\ngetting established at Cedar. Her daughter, Margaret Salwyn,\nremembers Wilson as a polite upper-class Englishman, a bit\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 171\non the “shabby genteel” side.\n“He tried to be friendly with me as a child,” she says. “He\nknew I was very fond of cats, so he drew a picture of a cat for\nme. He had very artistic-looking hands. I remember he used\nto point at you when he spoke. We thought it was rudeness,\nbut it was just a mannerism of his. He could speak well. My\ngrandmother said, ‘He’ll get by—he’s got the gift of the gab!’\n“It must have been around Easter that he stayed with us.\nI remember he laughed and said, ‘We used to sing a song at\nhome in England:\nHot cross buns,\nHot cross buns,\nIf your daughters don’t like them,\nGive them to your sons.’\n“My grandmother didn’t approve of some of his behaviour.\nAfter dinner, he’d come downstairs in his dressing-gown to\nstand near the fire. He felt the cold a lot. She’d say, ‘Now, Mr.\nWilson, you cannot come out of your room in your dressing-\ngown. Put on your proper clothes!’ It was considered quite\nvulgar to do that.\n“Or if the telephone rang, he’d come downstairs and ask if\nit was for him. My grandmother would say, ‘If the call were for\nyou, we’d tell you!’\n“One evening, everyone was talking in the living room.\n‘You know what I’m doing out at Cedar,’ he said, ‘I’m starting\na new religion.’ My grandmother thought it sounded a bit\nbatty, but was probably harmless enough. Then he said,\n‘I tell\nyou frankly, Mrs. Reynolds, it’s all a skin game.’ My grandmother\nand mother were quite disgusted when he said that. He only\nsaid it once, but the moment he made that declaration, they\nvowed to warn everyone against him.”\nr r r\nThe big locomotive roared through the night, its huge head-\nlight cutting through the darkness as it left the lights of Reno\n\n172 B R O T H E R X I I\nfar behind and raced up the Pacific Coast towards Seattle. In a\nfirst class compartment on board, Mary Connally waited impa-\ntiently for the train to reach British Columbia. Only a few days\nearlier in Asheville, she’d received a desperate telegram from\nWilson telling her he’d been arrested and imploring her to\ncome to Nanaimo at once. Mary’s response was immediate—\nshe was on a train the next day, making a last-minute dash\nacross the continent to appear in court on his behalf.\nIn his office in the Imperial Building at 97 Commercial\nStreet, Frank Cunliffe prepared Wilson’s defence. Notified by\nMary that she was on her way, he sent two telegrams to the\nUnion Pacific station in Everett, Washington. One was from\nhimself; the other was from Wilson, who wanted Mary to know\nhow grateful he was that she was coming to his aid.\n“Just before his trial, he sent for me,” Annie Barley recalled.\n“He told me he wanted me to go to Vancouver and meet Mrs.\nMary Connally, who had been providing funds for his work.\nHe said, ‘I want you to go and meet her and be very nice to\nher.’”\nThe train arrived in Vancouver that evening. Annie Barley\nmet Mary Connally at the railway station, and the two women\nstayed overnight in the city. At 3:11 \nP.M. the following after-\nnoon, Mary sent a telegram to Frank Cunliffe from the\nCanadian Pacific telegraph office in Vancouver: “TAKING\n5:30 BOAT. CAN YOU MEET ME? HAVE BLACK WHITE\nFUR COAT.”\nCunliffe was waiting on the wharf with his car when the\nPrincess Elaine docked. After the tension of the past few days,\nthe Nanaimo lawyer no doubt felt an enormous sense of relief\nwhen the patrician figure of “Lady Mary” Connally stepped off\nthe boat—his star witness had arrived.\nOn Thursday, November 1, Wilson’s preliminary hearing\nresumed. There was an expectant hush in the court, for in\nspite of the defence’s secrecy about the presence of an im-\nportant witness, the occasion was, as McKelvie described it,\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 173\n“something in the nature of a surprise party where the host\nand hostess meet the guests in evening dress.” The court was\nready for the surprise, and—true to its hopes—Frank Cunliffe\nproduced it.\n“Mrs. Mary Connally,” he called.\nAll eyes turned to watch as a nattily dressed woman with\nbaby blue eyes and flaxen hair stepped into the witness box.\nAlthough she was of uncertain age, it was obvious that a few\nyears earlier Mary had been a woman of rare beauty.\nMary was sworn in. When she gave her address as Reno,\nNevada, famous for its “divorce colony,” a murmur rippled\nthrough the courtroom. In answer to his questions, Mary\ntold Cunliffe that she’d arrived in Nanaimo the night before,\ncoming directly from Asheville, North Carolina.\n“You are the lady who has been referred to in these pro-\nceedings as having made a donation of twenty-three thousand\ndollars in August of this year?”\n“Yes Sir.”\n“There was an item before that of two thousand dollars?”\n“Yes.”\n“Tell us, briefly, how it came to be made.”\n“I was a member of the Order and very much interested\nin its future development, of which the Aquarian Foundation\nwas simply the beginning and ‘outer heart.’ This was to be fol-\nlowed by further developments, other settlements and places\nto be used as refuge places from life’s storms. I wished to help\ndevelop the new work of the Order, the present work and the\nfuture work, in which I am greatly interested, as I believe it\nis one of the most beautiful and idealistic programs in the\nworld.”\n“Do you know the accused?”\n“I have that honour.”\n“Did you have any conversation with him?”\n“Yes.”\n“Where?”\n“In Toronto.”\n\n174 B R O T H E R X I I\n“When?”\n“On August 15th last.”\n“And was that the occasion when this donation was decided\nupon?”\n“It was.”\n“To whom was this donation to be made?”\n“The donation was made to E. A. Wilson personally.”\n“Did the Aquarian Foundation have any interest in that\nmoney?”\n“It should not have done. It was made to him direct, per-\nsonally, entirely for him to do with as he pleased in connection\nwith his work.”\n“Now it appears that the draft was drawn payable to the\nAquarian Foundation?”\n“That was entirely Mr. Wilson’s desire. I would have pre-\nferred to make it payable to E. A. Wilson, but he said no, to let\nit go in the usual way to the Aquarian Foundation.”\n“Was anything said as to the manner in which the twenty-\nfive thousand dollars was to be dealt with?”\n“I told him he had absolute control, and that he could do\nwhat he wished with it. I approved of his principles and do so\nstill. His proposal was to have a new settlement which was to\nbe a place of refuge for people in time of trouble—this money\nwas to help his work along.”\n“It was to help what part of his work?”\n“Any part of his work. I left it absolutely to him as I had\nevery confidence in him and still do.”\n“Was anything said as to the division of the money in actual\namounts?”\n“Yes, it was proposed that ten thousand dollars should go\nas a loan to the Aquarian Foundation; eight thousand dollars\nwas to be put into the new settlement; and five thousand dol-\nlars was to be invested by Mr. Wilson at six percent for his own\nuse entirely. This last suggestion was entirely my own. This sug-\ngestion I made in Toronto.”\n“In other words, the personal donation of five thousand\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 175\ndollars was your own proposition voluntarily made?”\n“Oh yes. I still wish it, and I only wish I had made it more. I\nbelieve in Mr. Wilson’s principles and his integrity, and I have\ncome a great many thousand miles to testify on his behalf.”\nT.P. Morton cross-examined Mary. He asked her if she knew\nthe objects of the Aquarian Foundation.\n“I am not a Governor,” she replied.\n“For what purpose are these people carrying on?”\n“They are carrying on to help mankind.”\nMorton read aloud the objects of the Society: “‘To give\nteachings and instruction to its members upon philosophical\nand occult subjects, and upon all matters concerning their\nphysical, mental, and spiritual welfare; and to print and pub-\nlish such books, magazines, or documents as may be necessary\nfor that purpose.’ As far as you know are those the objects of\nthe Aquarian Foundation?”\n“That is only the beginning.”\n“What are the other objects?”\n“I am not ready to discuss that with you except to say that it\nis a good work and for the betterment of mankind.”\n“I suppose that in carrying out these objects it is purely\nhumanitarian and the members would naturally live decent\nmoral lives?”\n“I have nothing to do with that whatever. I made a donation\nto Mr. Wilson to assist him in his work.”\n“The objects of the fund, to your mind, do not include\nimmorality?”\n“No, certainly not. But I would like to know your definition\nof immorality—”\n“There has been no evidence here of immorality,” Frank\nCunliffe interjected.\n“I have already told you,” Mary impatiently explained, “that\nthe money was given to Mr. Wilson to be used at his discretion.\nI asked him if I should make the cheque payable to him per-\nsonally. He said, ‘No, make it out to the Aquarian Foundation.’\nI now believe I should have followed my own intuition in the\n\n176 B R O T H E R X I I\nmatter and made the cheque payable to him personally. The\nmoney was to be spent by E. A. Wilson as he saw fit. He could\nspend it in any way—personally, if he wished. It was a straight\ngift to him.”\n“You gave it to him as a straight gift?” asked Beevor-Potts.\n“Yes.”\n“If you had known that this money was to be used for im-\nmoral purposes, would you have donated it?” asked Morton.\n“It all depends on what you call ‘immoral’ purposes. I have\nnot come here to discuss why I gave this donation. I have come\nhere at considerable inconvenience and expense to make a\nstatement that this money was given by me to E. A. Wilson to do\nwith as he saw fit, and I still believe in Mr. Wilson’s integrity.”\n“That is all the defence, Your Worship,” Cunliffe stated.\nMary stepped down from the witness box. Frank Cunliffe\nsummed up the case for the defence. He said that everything\nhad been done in accordance with the understanding of the\ndonor, and that the twenty-five thousand dollars had never ac-\ntually been placed in the Aquarian Foundation account—the\nten thousand dollars that had been deposited was a temporary\nloan only. It was clear that the money hadn’t been stolen, he\nsaid, and that Wilson should be acquitted.\nMorton pointed out that although Mrs. Connally had do-\nnated the money for purposes outlined by Wilson, he hadn’t\ntold her of all his activities on Valdes Island. There was no\nquestion, he said, that Wilson should be committed to stand\ntrial.\nIn reviewing the evidence, Beevor-Potts stated that there\nwas one vital point: the money had been forwarded to the\nAquarian Foundation as a bank draft, unaccompanied by any\nletter of instruction. A month later after the trouble had de-\nveloped, Mrs. Connally had written a letter setting out her\nintentions. Beevor-Potts said that in view of the circumstances,\nhe didn’t think it was a case of a straight committal. He there-\nfore bound Wilson over on bail of five thousand dollars to\nappear at the fall assizes to answer any indictment that might\n\nWeird Occultism Exemplified 177\nbe preferred against him there.\nThe next day, Bruce McKelvie’s account of the hearing\nappeared on the front page of \nThe Province, headlined:\n“DRAMATIC SURPRISE AT AQUARIAN HEARING.”\nThe dingy courtroom of Magistrate C.H. Beevor-Potts\nThursday would have made an admirable setting for a\nmovie drama or a scene for one of the old-time plays of the\ncoal-oil circuit, where at the crucial moment of the trial of\nthe hero, the heroine, blonde and blue-eyed, bursts into\nthe group of serious-faced officials, lawyers and spectators\nto proclaim the innocence of the accused.\nSuch indeed, in brief, was what happened in fact when\nEdward Arthur Wilson, otherwise Brother XII of the\nAquarian Foundation, was called for his defence to the\ncharge that he had converted $13,000 of the funds of the\nFoundation to his own personal uses.\nThe only difference in the ending between this real-life\ndrama and the popular plot of playwrights was that the mag-\nistrate did not wholly free the accused from the toils of the\nlaw, but bound him over in the sum of $5,000 to appear at\nthe assizes in Nanaimo later this month. Nor did he follow\nthe stage custom and descend from the bench to grasp the\nhand of the hero and express his great gratification at his\ndeliverance from his accusers. With these minor exceptions\nthe situation was one that might have had its counterpart\non the boards.\nFrank Cunliffe was satisfied with the judgment. His client\nhadn’t been committed for trial, but had simply been placed\nunder bonds to answer a charge if the Attorney-General\nshould prefer one against him. “I do not expect anything fur-\nther will be done in connection with the charge,” he wrote to\na colleague, “as it is quite obvious there has been no theft.”\nBeevor-Potts’s decision to refer the case to the assizes caused\nconsiderable surprise in legal circles, especially in view of\n\n178 B R O T H E R X I I\nMary’s statement that her donation was an outright gift. The\njudgment was accepted to mean that the provincial govern-\nment intended to fully investigate the activities of Brother XII\nand the Aquarian Foundation.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan was\na powerful political\nforce in the 1920s.\nBrother XII solicited\nKlan support for\nhis own political\naspirations. This Klan\nmarch in Washington,\nD.C. took place\nAugust 8, 1925.\nIt was estimated that\nnearly sixty thousand\nKlansmen marched\nin the parade,\nwhile nearly a million\npersons watched\nthe spectacle.\nSenator James Thomas\nHeflin, who Brother\nXII hoped would be the\npresidential candidate for\nhis Third Party, speaks\nat a Klan rally in this\nphotograph taken June\n18, 1928. Original caption:\n“Invading his opponents’\nterritory, Senator Thomas\nHeflin of Alabama\naddressed some 10,000\nKu Klux Klansmen and\ntheir associates in a huge\nnatural amphitheater at\nHurstville, near Albany,\nN.Y., and renewed his attack\non Catholicism and Smith.\nThe Governor ordered\nState Police to guard\nthe loquacious Senator.”\n(Corbis)\n\nSenator James “Tom\nTom” Heflin was key to\nBrother XII’s political\nplans. In a speech\nat the Foundation\nheadquarters, Wilson\nstated: “In Washington\nin January last, I told\nSenator Heflin to get\ninto the limelight\nas the champion of\nProtestantism and\nto stay there. He has\nsince done that very\neffectively and is still\ndoing it.” (\nThe U.S.\nSenate Historical Office\n)\nIn the August 1928\nissue of The Chalice,\nBrother XII urged\nU.S. congressmen\nto support his Third\nParty and Protestant\nProtective League\nin order to prevent\na civil war from\nerupting in the\nUnited States. The\nquotation “Give\nup thy life if thou\nwould’st live” is from\nH.P. Blavatsky.\n\nA collection of Brother\nXII’s political articles\npublished in book form.\nHis “Open Letter to Certain\nSenators, Representatives\nand Leaders in the United\nStates of America,”\nreprinted in this volume,\nwas described as “the\nmost important and\nvital document issued\nin the United States\nsince the Declaration\nof Independence.” In\nother articles, Brother\nXII warned about the\npower of the press to\nshape public opinion, a\nprophetic injunction in\nlight of the contemporary\nmanufacturing of consent\nby corporate media.\nThis low relief from\nthe temple of Horus at\nEdfu, carved between\n181 and 145 B.C.,\nshows the god Osiris\nreceiving the double\ncrown of Upper and\nLower Egypt from the\ngoddesses Isis and\nNephthys. Filmmaker\nDavid Cherniack, who\nproduced a Brother XII\ntelevision documentary\nin 2002, felt that the\ncarving could represent\nBrother XII and his\ntwo consorts, Myrtle\nBaumgartner as Isis\nand Mabel Skottowe as\nNephthys, his seducer\nand destroyer.\n\nThis bizarre headline appeared in the Vancouver Daily Province on October\n31, 1928, in an article describing the affair between Brother XII and\nMyrtle Baumgartner, the wife of a New York physician.

They’d received\nBrother XII’s General Letter telling them about the crisis, as\nwell as a letter from the dissenting Governors. Many had read\nabout the petition to dissolve the Society in the newspaper,\nsince the story had been reported in \nThe New York Times and\nother large American dailies. But most members didn’t know\nwho to believe or what to think. Many simply resigned from\nthe Foundation, but a surprising number wrote to Brother XII\nat the headquarters, expressing their support and affirming\ntheir loyalty to the Work.\nBrother XII read the letters in his office in the Center\nBuilding. The mail had poured in from across the conti\nnent, from addresses like the prestigious Cosmos Club in\nWashington, D. C., the Security Building in Tulsa, Oklahoma,\nthe Cotton Exchange in Memphis, Tennessee, and the\n\n180 B R O T H E R X I I\nheadquarters of the Knights of American Protestantism—\na splinter group of the Ku Klux Klan—in Muncie, Indiana.\nFoundation members in Florida, Texas, Kentucky, Kansas,\nMissouri, Illinois, Michigan, California, Colorado, Virginia,\nand numerous other states rallied to the cause. A note of en\ncouragement even arrived from Dr. Carl Ramus, a physician\nworking on Ellis Island in New York. Brother XII was gratified\nby this strong show of support.\nIn Los Angeles, a car sped along the Santa Monica freeway\npast rows of white stucco buildings and pastel bungalows.\nInside was a determined trio of Brother XII loyalists, led by\nIda Mary Trask, the Divisional Secretary of Los Angeles. The\ntall English teacher and lover of Milton and Dante had imme\ndiately responded to Brother XII’s predicament. Together\nwith fellow members Ned Barmore and W. J. Barnett, she\ndrafted a resolution in support of him. In the form of a proxy,\nit protested the Governors’ court action against Brother XII,\nexpressed confidence in his leadership, and gave him the\nlegal right to represent each person who signed it. Along the\npalm lined boulevards of greater Los Angeles the three drove,\ntaking the resolution before groups in Pasadena, Hollywood,\nSanta Monica, Redondo Beach, and Long Beach. The pile\nof resolutions in Ida’s lap grew steadily smaller as she distrib\nuted them to the group secretaries and urged the members\nto carry on during the crisis, so that the Los Angeles division\ncould continue in harmony.\nIda wrote to Brother XII, telling him that the Los Angeles\nmembers had been following the court cases in the Vancouver\nnewspapers. She enclosed a copy of the resolution and told\nhim: “I believe that nearly everyone in this Division will sign\nit without question. I am going to tell them all that it is a\nvoluntary matter on their part, and that you have not asked for\nit\n. The Division here is sticking to ‘The Message.’ They know\nTHE MASTER \nis the head of the Work. They know the ‘storm’\nwas one of personality, that if one understands ‘The Message,’\npersonal issues should not be considered at all.”\n\nThe Storm of Personality 181\nBrother XII appreciated Ida’s spirited defence of him. With\nits more than fifty groups, California was a stronghold of the\nFoundation and he wanted to retain as many members there\nas possible. He made copies of the resolution and sent it out\nto other groups across the continent to collect additional\nsignatures, which he could present as evidence when the pe\ntition to dissolve the Aquarian Foundation was heard by the\ngovernment.\nIn the Everett Building in Akron, Ohio, a frosted glass door\nengraved with the words “Aero Rubber Company” opened\ninto the reception area for Joseph Benner’s two modest busi\nnesses. A door beyond led into a large room with several desks\nand a typewriter. Here, Benner’s assistants put up orders for his\nspecialty rubber business, while in an adjoining office, Benner\nhimself operated the Sun Publishing Company, publishers\nand distributors of books on the inner life. The quiet but in\ntense author of \nThe Impersonal Life was both a Governor and\nthe Eastern Divisional Secretary of the Aquarian Foundation.\nIn his book lined office, Benner conducted the business of\nthe Society, keeping membership records, holding group\nmeetings, and receiving patrons. Over the past few weeks,\nhe’d dispatched urgent letters and telegrams to Brother XII,\nasking for an explanation of the recent events at the head\nquarters. He’d received no real answers, only promises to\nexplain. Unsatisfied by Brother XII’s replies and weighing the\nevidence the other Governors had sent, Benner decided that\nBrother XII had failed and was unfit to carry on the Work.\nBenner wrote a general letter to the members in his division,\nexplaining that although it seemed inconceivable, Brother\nXII would no longer be with them in the Work. He asked the\nmembers to be as understanding and lenient as possible: “If\nour Brother has sinned and failed in his Trust, it is because he\nis still human and essayed the heights before he had purified\nhis nature of elements that could not stand the brilliant Light\nof the Impersonal Power of such heights.” Benner told the\nmembers he would soon issue a series of monthly Instructions.\n\n182 B R O T H E R X I I\nHe exhorted them: “Hold steady and know that what is of God\nwill stand forever, and that error will fall of its own weight.”\nBenner also wrote to Earle and Josephine Coffin, divisional\nsecretaries in Dayton, Ohio, asking for their help in carrying\non the Work. “Additional confirming evidence has come to\nme to prove that the Brother has run amuck,” he told them.\n“The Power that came to him was too much for him to stand\nand it has broken him, as it will break all those who are not\nfirmly established in the \nChrist consciousness, recognizing\nno source or authority but our loving Father in His Kingdom\nwithin each one of us.”\nBenner pointed out that Brother XII’s General Letter had\nbeen a subtle appeal to the members to sustain him \npersonally\nin the wrong path he’d chosen, and said that they must be true\nto principle, not personality. “From now on,” he urged them,\n“the work of self training must become a real and daily act, in\nspired with the fiery zeal that alone will win to the Kingdom\nof Heaven.”\nBut the Coffins were unsympathetic to Benner’s new pro\ngram. While they did not doubt his sincerity, they saw his\nhasty effort to start his own organization as an obvious grab\nfor power. How could he possibly claim to know all the facts\nin the case, they asked him, when he hadn’t been at the head\nquarters himself? His “facts” were only the opinions of the\nother Governors. And by \nwhat authority had he assumed the\nleadership? Why couldn’t he at least have waited for a general\ncall from the membership? The Coffins immediately wrote\nto Brother XII, telling him of Benner’s attempt to usurp the\nleadership of the Foundation.\nBrother XII now faced another legal battle in his attempt\nto regain control of the Aquarian Foundation. On October\n25, 1928, Von Platen, DeLuce, and Lucas had obtained an\ninjunction preventing him from using any funds in the Foun\ndation bank accounts and from transacting any business of\nthe Society, including issuing general letters to the member\n\nThe Storm of Personality 183\nship. It was critical to Wilson’s plans that he succeed in having\nthe injunction overturned.\nOn the afternoon of his preliminary hearing on November 1,\nboth Wilson and Mary Connally had filed affidavits in the in\njunction proceedings. Mary reiterated the testimony she’d\ngiven in court and swore that she was well aware at the time\nshe’d made her donation of the manner in which it would\nbe used by Wilson. She stated that the Aquarian Foundation\nhad no right to any part of her $25,000 donation, other than\nsuch interest as the defendant chose to give it. In his affidavit,\nWilson discussed the Hess Trust, saying he’d converted some\nGrand Trunk Railway bonds into money, obtaining for them\n$2,446.14, but that he’d deposited a certified cheque for that\namount in the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Nanaimo, and\nthat the Trust fund was intact. He charged that the plaintiffs\nhad entered into a conspiracy to entirely destroy the Aquarian\nFoundation and the work upon which he was engaged.\nVon Platen, Lucas, and DeLuce filed counter affidavits,\nstating that they only wanted the Society’s funds to be returned\nto their respective donors. Lucas said he’d been instructed by\nOliver Hess to secure the return of the Hess Trust, and that\nit would be contrary to the interests of justice if Wilson were\nonce more clothed with the power to dispose of the securities\nin the fund. Robert England and James Lippincott also filed\naffidavits in the case. England repeated his Osiris Isis charge,\nwhile Lippincott offered the following glimpse of Wilson and\nMyrtle together:\n“In the house occupied by the said Wilson at the said\nMandieh Settlement, there was but one bed, which I verily\nbelieve was occupied by the said Wilson and the woman who\nlived there with him. On one occasion, having taken my leave\nof the said Wilson and the said woman, I stepped out of the\nhouse and as I passed the window of the said house, I observed\nsaid Wilson and the said woman in close embrace.”\nBruce McKelvie continued to cover the story for \nThe\nProvince. In a front page article, headlined: “MAN FROM\n\n184 B R O T H E R X I I\nCARTHAGE, MO. HELPED REINCARNATED B.C.\nEGYPTIAN GOD,” he reported Wilson’s financial dealings\nwith Hess and described the contents of the various affidavits\nfiled in the proceedings. McKelvie explained that some mem\nbers’ faith in their leader had been shaken by Brother XII’s\nclaim in his encyclical letter from England that he’d never\nbeen in southern British Columbia in the physical body: “Later\ndiscovery that he had been employed by the Dominion Express\nCompany in Victoria, and had lived about twenty years ago in\nVancouver and Calgary, shattered to some extent the ethereal\nromance suggested in his Southampton declaration.”\nIn Carthage, Missouri, Oliver Hess laboriously typed a letter\nto Brother XII, asking for the return of his securities. He ex\nplained that he wanted the fund to be spent for the benefit of\nmankind, “not for the glorification or credit of personality.”\nHess told Wilson that the other Governors had written of him\nonly in the kindest of terms, “but as I think you have, in a mea\nsure, failed so far, we had better commence anew, and with\nbetter understanding than we had at first.”\nHess’s lawyer, Howard Gray, also wrote to Wilson, re\nquesting the return of the bonds, though he advised him that\nonce he straightened out his problems, “it is more than likely\nthat Mr. Hess will again donate the bonds for the purposes\nmentioned.”\nOn Tuesday, November 6, the injunction proceedings were\nheld in Vancouver before Chief Justice W.A. MacDonald.\nFrank Cunliffe was facing Edward Lucas, who was appearing\nin the dual role of plaintiff and counsel. Cunliffe opened the\nproceedings, arguing that the facts in the case clearly showed\nthat the plaintiffs were not entitled to an injunction. The terms\nof the injunction were also wider than justified, he said, since\nit denied Wilson access to his own bank account—he couldn’t\neven use his money to buy a meal. Lucas agreed to amend\nthe injunction to release sufficient money for Wilson’s imme\ndiate needs, but Cunliffe rejected this concession. Instead, he\nargued that the injunction had been improperly granted in\n\nThe Storm of Personality 185\nthe first place. It was on this argument, bristling with legal\ntechnicalities, that the two lawyers fought it out in a formidable\ndisplay of rhetoric. Cunliffe also argued that the injunction se\nriously affected the rights of individuals not before the court,\nsince the Aquarian Foundation was a world wide organiza\ntion, with branches in the United States, Great Britain, South\nAfrica, Australia, and New Zealand. Lucas responded that the\nGovernors represented the membership and he could supply\nthe evidence to prove it. The battle raged until late in the af\nternoon, when the magistrate adjourned the proceedings.\nOn Friday, November 9, after Cunliffe and Lucas had\nsummed up their arguments, Chief Justice MacDonald an\nnounced his decision. “In my opinion, the injunction should\nbe dissolved,” he declared. “Simply put, the framework of the\naction is wrong. It is alleged in the affidavit that the Aquarian\nFoundation is a Society incorporated under the Societies Act\nof British Columbia. If its rights were invaded, it should be\na party to the action. Without it being a party, any order de\nciding its rights would be unwarranted.”\nIt was a crucial victory. A jubilant Wilson congratulated\nFrank Cunliffe on a brilliant courtroom performance. He was\nin control of the Foundation again and could now write to the\nmembers explaining his actions.\nr r r\nBrother XII immediately issued a General Letter addressed\n“TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS WORK.” He\nthanked everyone who’d written to him and told the mem\nbers they were to consider this a personal letter to each and\nevery one of them:\n“We have all passed through, and are now passing through,\na time of terrible trial and testing, but we should remember\nthat those who endure to the end \nmust be tried as by fire, for\nis it not written—‘these are they who have come out of great\ntribulation’? This fierce attack has been allowed to develop\n\n186 B R O T H E R X I I\nagainst us for two reasons: (1) that each may be proven in the\nmatter of loyalty to our Cause, of faith in our own integrity of\npurpose, and of unselfish devotion to the Right. (2) that the\ntreacherous, the disloyal, and the self interested may depart\nfrom us in this hour.”\nHe advised the members that the official Society known as\nthe Aquarian Foundation belonged to the first stage of the\nWork, and that the time was nearly ripe for the disintegration\nof its outward form:\nThe outer Society was the means we used for the collec\ntion of material; the present crisis is the means used for the\ndetection and rejection of those weak and faulty elements\nwhich are always attracted to any “new” movement. \nWith\nthat which remains, we are about to commence the building of the\nTemple. \nIf to you is given a part in this glorious work, know\nthat it is because you have earned the right and have passed\nthe preliminary testing. Take to yourselves that verse which\nsays—“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple\nof my God, \nand he shall go no more out.” (Rev. III., 12). The\nclamour, the uncertainties, and the bitter strife of personal\nlives will surge around you, but you shall remain unmoved\nand undismayed, your feet set upon a sure Foundation.\nFrom that date forward, Brother XII told the members, the\nWork would take a different form:\nThere will be no material or outward organization: the\nbonds which knit us together will be invisible to any but\nourselves; they will consist of Faith, Loyalty, and the Will\nto serve. The mind will know, the heart will respond, the\nindividual will serve. Learn to regard this Society known as\nthe Aquarian Foundation for what it is; it is now but the\nchrysalis, the soon to be empty shell. You who issue from it\nshall shortly emerge into a world of sunlight, of spiritual\nconsciousness hitherto unknown to you.\n\nThe Storm of Personality 187\nNature and super nature have set their guards about this\ntransformation, so that none but the sincere may pass. The\nshell is broken and that which it contained must sink or rise\naccording to laws as inexorable as that of gravity in the ma\nterial world. There will be no chance for deception, and\nno mistaken judgments. Wait in patience for our further\nword.\nYour Brother in Service,\nXII\nJust as this letter was going to press, Brother XII received\nthe letter from Earle and Josephine Coffin in Dayton, Ohio.\nThey enclosed a copy of the letter Joseph Benner had issued\nto members and explained that he was attempting to take over\nthe leadership of the Foundation.\nBrother XII was furious. Benner’s action was the last link\nneeded to prove the nature and extent of the conspiracy against\nhim. He stopped the press and added a ringing postscript:\nBrothers and Sisters, hear the truth. At the very moment\nBenner wrote his letter, he had in his possession a copy of\nmy General Letter for November in which I took up spe\ncifically every personal charge against myself. We could not\nissue it here owing to an injunction of the court secured by\nthese traitors expressly to prevent us taking any action to\nmake the real facts known. The letter was, therefore, sent\nto Benner, asking him to print it in Akron and distribute to\nall our members.\nBENNER HAS DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED THAT\nLETTER, and has not given you the slightest hint that it was\never written. I ask you if such an action would be taken by\nan honest man? Do you think that a man who stoops to such\ninfamy is a fit leader for our own Work? His letter breathes\nthe very spirit of hypocrisy and contains deliberate lies. Read\nthe fourth paragraph on the first page: it is Benner and\nthese infamous conspirators who “will no longer be with us\n\n188 B R O T H E R X I I\nin the Work he (myself) established in our hearts and lives.”\nHere he unconsciously admits a little of the truth—he and\nthese others established nothing; they have only torn down\nand destroyed. . .\nThe truth that this whole tragedy is a deep and cunning\nplot is now overwhelming and indisputable. My November\nLetter suppressed by Benner will follow immediately; when\nyou have that you will be in possession of the true facts; \nthen\nshall you make your choice, whether you will stand with\nThe Brother XII and this Work, or with those traitors who\nare trying to destroy it for their own personal gain and am\nbition for leadership. Our associate Benner has earned a\nnew name—not Joseph Benner but JUDAS Benner from\nhenceforth.\nBrother XII now issued the November General Letter, in\nwhich he answered the charges that had been brought against\nhim. There were three basic charges: first, that he’d lost all\nknowledge of the plan of the Lodge—if he’d ever had it;\nsecond, that he was wrongfully using the funds of the Aquarian\nFoundation to further his personal plans; and finally, that he\nwas openly immoral in his personal life. These charges were\nsummed up in the more general charge that he was “black”\nand had been abandoned by the Elder Brothers because of\npersonal failure.\nBrother XII emphatically denied the charges. “There has\nbeen no personal failure,” he declared, “and there shall be\nnone, unless it be the breakdown of the physical body under\nthe tremendous strain now put upon it.”\nHe claimed that upon close examination, none of the\ncharges were supported by any evidence. In answer to the first\nand second charges, he explained that the founding of the\nMandieh Settlement was part of the original plan—it was the\nactual “Center of Safety” referred to over and over again in\nearlier writings, the manifestation of the program announced\nin \nThe Message. The donation given by Mary Connally was spe\n\nThe Storm of Personality 189\ncifically for that purpose, he said, and wasn’t intended for the\nAquarian Foundation. He had the signed declaration of the\ndonor upon that point.\nIn answer to the charge that he was openly immoral in his\npersonal life, Brother XII replied by giving an account of the\ncircumstances of his relationship with Myrtle Baumgartner—\nalthough not identifying her by name. He made it clear that\nhe considered her a fellow “Brother” and initiate:\nThe first stage of this Work was individual—I alone gave\n“The Message,” built up the outer organization, and gave\nthe subsequent teachings and instructions you have re\nceived. These writings are my witness—a living witness that\nwill endure long after those who try to destroy it are for\ngotten. My work will live.\nThe second stage of this Work is not individual, but dual\nin its nature; its labours and responsibilities are shared by\nanother of our Inner Order. Together, we have to teach the\nlaws governing the true relationship of man to man, of par\nents and children, and of that alliance between man and\nwoman which we are used to call marriage. That this work\nmay be done with a perfect understanding of every angle of\nthe problems involved, it was essential that one of us should\ntake a feminine embodiment. This my Brother has done.\nFor many years past, \nwe have worked together on inner\nplanes; but the time has now come when we must work as\none, outwardly and in the life of the physical world. We\nhave to teach by example and action, not only by words.\nWe have to \nlive the life, and that means to show men and\nwomen what the true marriage relationship is, as distin\nguished from the conventional and the false. That brings\nus into conflict with the standards, conventions, and preju\ndices of the existing order. It cannot be otherwise, for these\nrepresent conditions which are characteristic of fifth race\nmethods and misinterpretations. If we were conventional,\ncareful of personal reputation, no work could be done, and\n\n190 B R O T H E R X I I\nwe would be spiritually dead, or at least in bondage to the\nold order, impotent to lead the way or to declare the truth\nthat makes men free.\nI am charged with maintaining a marriage relationship\nwith one to whom I am not legally married. It is quite true,\nand some, though not all, of the reasons for this course, I\nam now putting before you. But the charge that my course\nis immoral is not true. It is unconventional, and the world at\nlarge confuses morals with conventions. The existing mar\nriage laws of civilized countries are demonstrably immoral\nand at variance with the divine scheme. A young girl may be\nmarried to an old man of seventy (for wealth or worldly po\nsition), and the relationship be considered entirely moral\nand proper. But should she love one of her own age out\nside the conventional marriage tie, she is damned socially\nand morally by the conventionalists of all classes. To infer\nentially sanction the existing scheme by subscribing to it\nourselves would be a hypocritical surrender of principle to\nexpediency.\nIn forming your judgment in this matter, remember that\nthe course I have to follow \nwas chosen deliberately. We who\nmust together tread this road met for the first time in our\nphysical bodies recently, and discussed it fully. We consid\nered the sacrifices it demanded, the bitter trial to ourselves\nand others, and the terrible personal sufferings involved\nin the loss of friends, and the condemnation of almost all\nothers. We looked these things in the face, we counted the\ncost fully, and \nwe are willing to pay the price. Never for one in\nstant was it a matter of an ordinary personal attraction. This\nis what our enemies would have you believe, and what most\nof you will believe. For both of us the personal equation is\nthe one thing that has been set aside. We are willing to sac\nrifice all for the sake of the work we have undertaken.\nYou cannot judge of this matter as though it were an or\ndinary personal delinquency. It is nothing of the kind. It\nis a necessary and exceedingly bitter experience—a hard,\n\nThe Storm of Personality 191\nrough portion of the path I have undertaken to tread. It\nis not self gratification. It is self immolation on the part of\nthose who would, if need be, give their bodies to be burned\nthat we may bear witness to the truth.\nBrother XII then answered the most controversial charge\nbrought against him, that he’d claimed to be a reincarnation\nof the Egyptian god Osiris:\nAn untruth which is now being circulated amongst our\nmembers is that I have stated that I am “an incarnation of\nOsiris” and that my helpmate in this work is Isis. I never\nat any time made that statement. The story was started by\nRobert England and is part of the plot to discredit our Work.\nSuch things could only be said or inferred by persons utterly\nignorant of spiritual verities. Osiris Isis are living Principles\nin Nature, not personal god and goddess. In the Mysteries,\nthey symbolized this very Principle of Duality of which the\nmodern world is entirely ignorant. The worship of Osiris\nIsis was really a study of, and an understanding of the dual\naspect of the spiritual Monad, inseparable from manifesta\ntion \nin form. To that extent, every person is an “incarnation”\nof one or other of these dual Principles. But there are few\ntoday who have any knowledge of the “dual law,” and it is\nour work to restore in part that knowledge to mankind. The\n“divine child” Horus symbolized the concrete brain knowl\nedge of those truths, which are “born” into the world of\nmen as the result of a knowledge of the Dual Law which\ngoverns the \nunion of the Osiris Isis Principles in nature.\nThis close association, which the ignorant and the unchar\nitable label as “immoral” is in reality a very sacred thing—far\nmore so than the ordinary, conventional marriage tie, and\nhaving claims which are immeasurably greater. Also, it is a\nmatter of the greatest significance to mankind generally at\nthis time. You may gain a hint of that significance if you\nknow where to look for it. . .\n\n192 B R O T H E R X I I\nBrother XII referred members to When the Sun Moves\nNorthward, a mystical treatise that linked the stages of human\ninitiation with the solar year. He quoted the following\npassage:\n“It is only in the occult ceremonies and vigils that the rec\nognition of spiritual comrades can take place. If, when the\nconsciousness comes to you of those who are your true com\npanions, you find one who is a friend on earth, then may you\nknow that you have gone far indeed upon the path. To be\npowerful enough to attain an association with a companion\non the physical as well as on the psychic plane means that\nthe divine part of the man has been able to unfold a petal of\nits lotus flower and to permit its sweetness to become a fra\ngrance that can reach the outer sense. For this so wonderful\nthing must come from on high; it means that two initiates\nare fated or permitted to meet upon earth—a marvel in an\naeon.”\nWhen this tremendous thing referred to as a “meeting of\ntwo initiates” takes place in physical bodies, it is the sign and\nsymbol of a mighty work. It is not only a “marvel in an aeon”\nbut it marks in this case the beginning and the end of an\naeon. How many of you will ignorantly misjudge this signif\nicant event as a mere vulgar personal delinquency? Upon\nyour judgment and decision of this event your own spiritual\nstanding will be decided, as will also your progress or your\nretrogression through many future lives.\nBrother XII advised the members that further information\nregarding the second stage of the Work would be available\nshortly. He closed by thanking “the many friends and mem\nbers who have sent me such splendid letters of loyalty and\nencouragement during this dark time of trial. I thank you all\nfrom my heart.”\nr r r\n\nThe Storm of Personality 193\nConspicuously absent from Brother XII’s General Letter was\nany mention of his recent involvement in American politics.\nOnly a week earlier, on November 6, 1928, a record number\nof Americans had flocked to the polls and elected Herbert\nHoover president of the United States in a national landslide.\nAlfred Smith won only eight states, losing even his home state\nof New York. Convinced he’d been defeated because of his re\nligion, he announced he’d never again run for public office.\nBrother XII no doubt felt vindicated by the election results,\nbelieving that together with other Protestant activists, he’d\ncontributed to the defeat of the Roman Catholic candidate.\nBut even so, the election underscored the fact that none of his\npredictions had come true: the P.P.L. and the Third Party had\nbeen dismal failures; he hadn’t selected the next president of\nthe United States; and Roman Catholics hadn’t slaughtered\nProtestants in the bloody civil war he’d predicted. In the af\ntermath of the election, he quietly abandoned any further\npolitical plans.\nTwo days after the election, as the \nPrincess Charlotte plowed\nthrough the waters of the Strait of Georgia, John Harrison\nperformed his last official act as Secretary of the Protestant\nProtective League. In his ornate handwriting, the florid\nEnglishman and former department store executive wrote out\nhis resignation from the P.P.L. on B.C. Steamship stationery.\nHarrison had relentlessly pushed the interests of the League for\nthe past year and was exhausted by the effort. “I finally broke!”\nhe wrote Wilson, “and brought on my old trouble of \nshell-shock,\nwith complications.” He explained that he’d shut down the\nP.P.L. office in Vancouver, since it seemed pointless to con\ntinue. But although disenchanted by the League’s failure and\nthe political infighting at the headquarters, he assured Brother\nXII: “I am with you,” and added, “Brother, I think of you as I\nknew you at first, and no one can take that from me!”\nBrother XII was unmoved by Harrison’s expression of\nloyalty. “I have your letter of recent date,” he replied. “It is\n\n194 B R O T H E R X I I\nevasive to a degree and the concluding sentences are an insult\nto my intelligence. I estimate your ‘love’ for me at exactly its\ntrue value.” He went on to accuse Harrison of misappropriating\nseven hundred dollars of P.P.L. funds and of conspiring with\nRobert England against him. He also threatened him with\nlegal action unless he swore out an affidavit giving full partic\nulars of the plot: “I am determined to sift every phase of this\nconspiracy and to convict every person concerned therein.\nI am not inclined to take definite action against yourself\nPROVIDED you assist me to bring these others to justice.”\nAstonished that Brother XII should turn against him,\nHarrison wrote back, giving the accounting he’d demanded\nand explaining: “The two hundred dollars was to meet cur\nrent expenses then overdue, and the five hundred dollars was\nsanctioned by you to carry on over the crisis, as the P.P.L. was\nat that time to go ahead at all costs.” He also reminded Wilson\nhe’d given up a lucrative position with the department store\nto work for the League, and the consequent neglect of his per\nsonal affairs had cost him about two thousand dollars. “It was\njust over a year ago that we started, and today I haven’t the\nprice of a streetcar fare!”\nHarrison wasn’t taking sides in the dispute. “I was ap\nproached in Victoria to give evidence for the Lucas Von Platen\noutfit,” he told Wilson. “I refused. They had better keep away\nfrom me. I have finished with the whole thing, and I hope no\none ever mentions it to me again!”\nIn the Belvedere Hotel in Sooke Harbour, on the outskirts\nof Victoria, Mary Connally waited for the opening of the fall\nassizes in Nanaimo. The hotel was an old hunting lodge, with\na totem pole out front and stables in the back. It was a fa\nvourite hideaway for wealthy tourists who hunted deer, bear,\nand cougar in the surrounding woods. The Belvedere was a\nsanctuary for Mary, a place where she could retreat from the\nglare of publicity surrounding Wilson’s preliminary hearing.\nShe dreaded the prospect of appearing in court again at the\n\nThe Storm of Personality 195\nNanaimo assizes. On November 13, a week before the as\nsizes, she wrote to Attorney General R. H. Pooley, requesting a\nmeeting with him. She enclosed a copy of a clipping from The\nNanaimo Daily Herald about Wilson’s hearing.\n“I came a great many miles at a very inconvenient time to\ntestify to the innocence of Mr. Wilson,” she explained, “and\nmy own specific instructions at the time I made my gift. I was\namazed to find my word doubted and a further hearing de\nmanded. I have been quite stunned by the newspaper reports\nwhich have been broadcast in the Eastern papers. My family\nare sending frantic letters and telegrams offering— even\nthreatening—to send out family lawyers. I have been staying as\nquietly as possible in this little hotel waiting for the 20th, when\nit occurred to me that perhaps you might be able and willing\nto help me avoid another courtroom ordeal. Am coming into\nVictoria for the day tomorrow early, and hope you can spare\nme half an hour. . .”\nAlthough there’s no record of what transpired during the\nmeeting, it’s unlikely that Pooley could offer Mary any assis\ntance beyond the assurance that Wilson would receive an\nimpartial hearing. He may have also explained that given\nher earlier testimony on Wilson’s behalf, and the ambiguous\nnature of the charge against him, it was by no means certain\nthat she would be called as a witness. In any case, Mary could\nat least take heart in Wilson’s oft repeated utterance that these\nevents were a test, and that once the crisis was past, she herself\nwould play an important part in the next stage of the Work.\nr r r\nIn Nanaimo, on the morning of November 20, 1928, the\nfall assizes opened. The courtroom was packed, since the\ncriminal and civil cases that were tried during the week long\nhearings were always a major source of interest to the resi\ndents of the colliery town. At eleven o’clock, Chief Justice\nAulay M. Morrison, an imposing figure in his black robes and\n\n196 B R O T H E R X I I\nwig, called the court to order. After swearing in the members\nof the grand jury, he reviewed the cases on the docket. In ad\ndition to the charges against England and Wilson, the week’s\ncases included rape, assault, perjury, opium smuggling, and\nthe sexual abuse of a ten year old girl. When Morrison had fin\nished, Victor B. Harrison, Crown Counsel, stepped forward\nand stated that the Attorney General’s office had instructed\nhim to have the charge against Wilson traversed to the next\nassizes because the principal witness for the Crown, Robert\nEngland, had not appeared. Harrison explained that England\nwas out on bail and the police had been searching for him.\n“Has he absconded?” asked Morrison.\n“I do not know, Your Honour,” replied Harrison. “I only\nknow that he cannot be located.”\nLucas and DeLuce were obviously perturbed by England’s\nabsence. As England’s bondsmen, they stood to forfeit their\nbail if he didn’t show up. Lucas could lose his house in\nVancouver, and DeLuce twenty five hundred dollars. Eng\nland’s failure to appear seemed like an admission of guilt, and\nwithout his testimony they were certain the charge against\nWilson would be dismissed. Chief Justice Morrison told\nHarrison that he’d postpone England’s case until the next af\nternoon and hear the charge against Wilson later that week.\nThe following day, England still hadn’t been located.\nMorrison announced that he’d be tried \nin absentia. Lucas\nstood up and told the magistrate he had some material evi\ndence that should go before the grand jury. The magistrate\ndirected Harrison to endorse Lucas’s name upon the bill. The\ngrand jury filed out to hear Lucas’s evidence \nin camera.\nWilson immediately suspected a trick. According to his own\naccount, he slipped out of the courtroom and made his way\ndown the hall to the grand jury room. Pausing outside the\nclosed chamber, he listened at the door. The voices were muf\nfled and he couldn’t hear them clearly, but he could tell that\nLucas was “jollying along” the members of the jury: “I myself\nheard roars of laughter as he was addressing them. . .” It\n\nThe Storm of Personality 197\nseemed obvious to Wilson that the charming and witty Lucas\nhad the grand jury eating out of the palm of his hand.\nThe jury members returned to the courtroom and the\nforeman announced the verdict—“No Bill” against Robert\nEngland. Wilson could only turn helplessly to Frank Cunliffe,\nappalled by what he considered a travesty of justice.\nCunliffe was also dismayed by the judgment, since he con\nsidered England guilty of theft. After the assizes were over, he\nwrote to the Attorney General, drawing his attention to the\nmatter. “It seems to me astounding to think that where a man\njumps his bail, all his bondsmen have to do is to get them\nselves before the grand jury on the pretext of giving evidence,\nand then in the course of that secret proceeding induce the\njury to bring in a ‘No Bill.’” He pointed out that Lucas could\nnot in any sense of the matter be regarded as a Crown wit\nness, and that his only interest in the matter was to save his\nown pocket. “I certainly would not have liked to have seen Mr.\nLucas obliged to put up the amount of the bail, and in a way,\nI suppose he can hardly be blamed for taking the steps that\nhe did to rid himself of that obligation. . . I do, however, feel\nstrongly that in this respect, there has been a gross miscar\nriage of justice.”\nThe next day, the grand jury considered the charge against\nWilson. Chief Justice Morrison made it clear to the jury\nwhat he thought the verdict should be. He explained that\nthe trouble was basically a squabble among the members of\nthe Foundation over who should control the assets: “In my\nopinion, there are other courts in the land to settle such dis\nputes. It is up to you to decide whether or not the time of the\nAssize Court should be taken up with such matters.”\nAfter the briefest of deliberations, the grand jury returned\nand announced its verdict: “No Bill” against Wilson.\nWilson was relieved and so was Mary Connally. The weeks of\nlegal struggle had ended in another decision in Brother XII’s\nfavour. His victory, however, was not the story of the assizes.\nThe real story was the mysterious disappearance of Robert\n\n198 B R O T H E R X I I\nEngland:\n“AQUARIAN TREASURER IS MISSING. ROBERT\nENGLAND, EX OFFICER, FAILS TO APPEAR AT ASSIZES.\nLAST SEEN IN SEATTLE. FRIENDS BELIEVE HE WAS\nCARRYING $2,800 ON HIS PERSON.”\nIn a front page story in \nThe Province, Bruce McKelvie\nasked: “What has become of Robert A. G. England, erstwhile\nSecretary Treasurer of The Aquarian Foundation at\nCedar by the Sea?”\nWhen he failed to turn up at the opening of the Nanaimo\nAssizes on Monday to face a charge brought against him by\nE. A. Wilson, leader and Brother XII of the Aquarian cult,\nthe suggestion was made that he had feared to face the\ncourt, but this his friends declare to be untrue. They con\ntend that he had no reason to doubt the outcome of the\ncase, and this has been borne out by the fact that the Grand\nJury returned “No Bill” in the indictment.\nThose who are intimate with England fear that he has\nmet with foul play in Seattle. England was formerly a secret\nservice agent for the United States Government, acting\nunder William J. Burns, and as such became a more or\nless familiar figure to denizens of the underworld. He was\nlast heard of in the Sound City on November 3, when he\nchecked out of the Calhoun Hotel, announcing that he was\nreturning to Vancouver. It was known, reports from Seattle\nstate, that he was carrying $2,800 on his person, and friends\nthere had remonstrated with him for so doing. This fact,\ntogether with surrounding circumstances, has aroused the\nfears of his friends in British Columbia.\nEdward Lucas was one of the most puzzled by England’s\ndisappearance. He couldn’t believe that a man of England’s\ncharacter would skip out and leave him and DeLuce to forfeit\ntheir bail. England had been staying with Lucas in Vancouver,\nand the lawyer had advised him to go to Seattle to bring\n\nThe Storm of Personality 199\nback the twenty eight hundred dollars he’d placed in the\nsafety deposit box.\n“At first, my father thought Bob had run out on him,”\nFrances Lucas recounts. “He felt sick about it—he couldn’t\nbelieve he’d do that. Then, in the long run, I think he de\ncided something must have happened to him. Bob’s clothes,\ntypewriter, and notebook—which I’m sure he must have trea\nsured—were all left at our home.”\nFrances recalls that there may have been another reason\nwhy England took the twenty eight hundred dollars from\nWilson’s bank account: “I think it had something to do with\nthe strategy in the court case, apart from the fact that the\nmoney was owing to Bob. My father and the others felt the\nmoney should be sequestered, so it was removed from the ac\ncount to put it beyond Brother XII’s reach. It seems to me that\nBob took that money to Seattle for a specific reason, which\nwasn’t only personal to him. But this is vague in my mind; I\ndon’t know the details.”\nThe last person apparently to see England was Nellie Little,\na young woman whose family owned the general store at\nCedar.\n“She was visiting her sister in Seattle,” Frances says, “when\nshe saw him at the bus station. He showed her the money he\nwas carrying, which was in cash. ‘You know, I think I’m being\nfollowed,’ he said. He got on the bus to come north, and from\nthat day forward, not one of us ever heard from Bob again.”\nRumours about England’s disappearance quickly spread.\nSome people said he’d gone missing off the B.C. Steamship\nferry between Vancouver and Nanaimo—that his luggage had\narrived, but he had not; he’d either been pushed overboard\nor dumped off a pier. Others claimed he’d disappeared on\nthe Vancouver Island highway somewhere between Nanaimo\nand Victoria. But England’s body was never found and none\nof the rumours could be substantiated.\nThere was even speculation that Brother XII might have\nhad a hand in England’s disappearance, since he stood to gain\n\n200 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe most if his former Secretary Treasurer failed to appear at\nthe assizes.\n“I seen a couple of guys come over to Valdes in a speedboat\nright around that time,” Arthur Nicholson recalls. “They were\ntalking to Wilson—left again the same day. They looked pretty\npeculiar to me. I call them ‘no good suckers.’ You know what\nI mean? I think he was bumped off.”\nAnother workman met with Brother XII the day before the\nassizes opened. He could tell that Wilson had more on his\nmind than the work they discussed on Valdes Island.\n“I walked over to the old man’s house at Cedar on Sunday\nmorning,” Dick Nicholson recalls. “Heavy snow on the\nground. He was in his pyjamas, and he seemed pretty upset\nabout something. England’s name came up, but he wouldn’t\ntalk about him. He seemed afraid of something. He said he’d\nbeen to Victoria that week. I thought later, well, if he went to\nVictoria, what was to stop him from going to Seattle, cause\nthat’s where England disappeared.”\nIn light of all this speculation, it should be noted that evi\ndence exists to suggest that England did, in fact, choose not to\nface the court. It does not prove, however, that a more sinister\nexplanation might also be possible.\nAn undated note from John Harrison to Wilson, discovered\nin Frank Cunliffe’s files, reads: “England has jumped his bail\nand gone. Lucas and DeLuce will have to find the amount.\nThis information is confidential to you.”\nAnd in his letter to the Attorney General, written after the\n“No Bill” judgment was brought in against England, Cunliffe\nwrites: “Some days before the assizes opened, it became more\nor less common knowledge that England had gone to the\nStates and would not return for his trial, and I passed along to\nMr. V. B. Harrison, Crown Counsel, such information as I had\nin this respect.”\nEngland’s fate remains a mystery. Among the papers\nhe left at the Lucas house were the astrological charts of a\nwoman named Marie Belle Abbott and her two children,\n\nThe Storm of Personality 201\nFrank Abbott—born in Fresno, California in 1909—and\nForrest Abbott—born in Los Angeles in 1911. England and\nthe forty one year old Marie Belle Abbott had both joined the\nAquarian Foundation in Oceano, California, and it’s possible\nthey were romantically involved. Perhaps England returned to\nCalifornia to be with her; and maybe Frank Abbott or Forrest\nAbbott, if they’re still alive, know whether or not their mother\nsaw him again—and what eventually became of him.\nr r r\nRobert England had been Brother XII’s closest advisor and\nconfidant for over a year. Working with him daily, he’d had\na unique opportunity to observe Wilson close up. When he\nresigned, England wrote a letter to Wilson, telling him, with\nunflinching honesty, exactly what he thought of him and why\nhe believed Wilson had failed in the Work:\nTo\nEdward Arthur Wilson\nPresident of The Aquarian Foundation\nand Owner of The Mandieh Settlement:\nThis declaration is addressed to you in the form of a\nletter in order that I may make plain to you at this time\nthe results of my fourteen months of incessant labour for a\nprinciple, fourteen months of constant observation of your\nworks, fourteen months of a steady listening to every word\nyou have spoken to me regarding the work of the Brothers\nof Light and their plans for humanity, and also the part or\nparts the Brother XII had, and still has, in the carrying out\nof those plans.\nBecause I am possessed of an excellent memory, a desire\nto always find out the why of everything, and a belief that the\nhigher the work and worker, the more careful we must be\n\n202 B R O T H E R X I I\nin proving them and their works, due to these, I have been\ngradually and very surely forced to come to the following\nconclusions that: –\n(1) The Brother XII is no longer working in or through\nthe body and faculties of Edward A. Wilson.\n(2\n) That the Master’s Consciousness was gradually with\ndrawn during the period from the latter part of\nJanuary to about the first day of July of this year,\n1928.\n(3\n) That the present plans of E.A.W. are not from the\nMaster, nor are they any part of the Plan of the\nWhite Lodge, but are rather the plans of two ordi\nnary human beings possessed of very keen and active\nbrains, namely Edward Arthur Wilson and Myrtle\nBaumgartner.\nThere are many incidents which I could recite, dating\nfrom early in 1928, which to me are proof of the above three\npoints because they show, even though they are often small\nthings, the inconsistency in many of the actions you have\nsaid were for other purposes, and the following are some of\nthe most vital points to be considered, namely: –\n1. A consistent and repeated failure to know or recog\nnize the very obvious characters of individuals met with at\nthe Center from time to time in past months who have ex\npressed a desire to take up some phase of the work, such\nas:—(a) Maurice Von Platen was always held in very high\nesteem by you until he expressed a desire or wish to control,\nor at least handle the finances; (b) You told others as well\nas myself that Ross Humble was a chela of the White Lodge\nwhen he first came here, but you later on condemned him\nas a thing of evil, and said that you had always known he\nwas black; (c) When Thomas Smith first came here, he ap\npeared very foul to me at first sight, and has remained so,\nbut you took him into the office and after being shown\nabout ten thousand dollars’ worth of letters of credit, you\nbrought him back out and asked me to look again and meet\n\nThe Storm of Personality 203\na real brother, with the results that he is making merry with\nthe women in Victoria; (d) It looks to me that you knew\nRobert DeLuce had reason to believe that he would be\nappointed your successor in the outer work, for you had\nyourself led him to believe that it would be so. I saw by your\nown thoughts when I told you that he planned to take con\ntrol by force that you had no idea of such a move. His plan\nwas helped along by Maurice Von Platen realizing that you\nhad used his money to take a trip with a woman, instead of\nfor political work. The idea that Robert DeLuce was the re\nincarnation of an Aztec sacrificial priest had never occurred\nto you until I told you of my own convictions in the matter\nwhich were, and still are, true so far as I am concerned, but\na few days later, I heard the story from J. J. Lippincott that\nyou had told him you had traced Robert’s past incarnations\nand had found that he was the reincarnation of an Aztec\nsacrificial priest. . . and (e) Your repeated failure to realize\nthat I was very carefully cataloguing all these for my own\nprotection later on, my reasons being that where the higher\nthings are concerned, I must be certain, and I had to prove\nto myself whether you were who and what you claimed to\nbe.\n2. The many attacks you have made upon individuals in\nyour published writings and in private letters has shown me\nthere was none of the love in you or the compassion an\nAdept of the White Lodge should and would show, or that a\nMaster of the Wisdom would show for his chelas. The work\ndone in Washington, and later in organizing the P.P.L. was,\nso far as I can see, good work and true work, but when the\npersonal ideas and plans of yourself took hold, it was all\nwrecked. You will perhaps remember that I told you there\nwas nothing to come from any of the P.P.L. work.\n3. Your present methods of getting money and property\ninto your own control, without telling those who give it all of\nthe facts connected with your present plans, is one I cannot\napprove of, for it is quite plain to me from the methods\n\n204 B R O T H E R X I I\nyou employ that you are now concerned only with the get\nting of money and a place. You added up the total receipts\nof cash roughly in your mind one day when we were out in\nyour boat not many weeks ago, and remarked in a tone of\nsatisfaction that it was not too bad considering the time you\nhad been at it. You have not told Mrs. Mary Connally all the\ndetails of your plans for the Mandieh Settlement, nor of\nyour present life there, nor of your past life. These latter are\nyour own personal affairs to some extent, but others who\nare associated with you are most certainly affected by them\nbecause you are the head of the A. F.\n4. When you told me of your trip to Chicago from Seattle\nwith Myrtle Baumgartner, and that a conception had taken\nplace, and that the offspring would be the World Teacher,\nand that you were the physical embodiment of the ancient\nEgyptian God Osiris, and that she was the physical embodi\nment of the Goddess Isis, and that the child would be the\nphysical embodiment of Horus, while the trip was said to\nhave been made in the interests of the P.P.L. and the polit\nical welfare of the people of the American continent, I used\na faculty you have never known I possess, and I followed the\nactual thoughts in your mind while you were talking to me.\nThey were very different from the words you spoke; and all\nthe while you were speaking, you were surrounded with a\ndull gray mist or fog, which was filled with hundreds of tiny\nimps dashing frantically about, and they were controlled\nby a helmeted and evil faced monk, who stood some feet\nbehind you with a hellish leer upon his face. You said at the\ntime that I might not believe what you were telling me, and\nI replied that I had worked out a lot of things in connection\nwith the matter and might believe quite a bit. . .\n5. Your present treatment of Elma is your own personal\naffair, but it serves as a detail in the measurement that I\nmust make. “By their fruits ye shall know them.” She has\ngiven you fifteen years of her life in faithful service. Even an\nordinary man of the world with a limited sense of honour\n\nThe Storm of Personality 205\nwould have at least gone to her once it was decided to un\ndertake the present arrangement on Valdes Island, and\nhave told her all the truth in the matter. She knows nothing\nas yet concerning the trip from Seattle to Chicago. . .\nThe letter abruptly ends—why England didn’t finish it\nisn’t known. Since it was discovered in Frank Cunliffe’s files,\nWilson must have read it—but under what circumstances? Did\nEngland present it to him the night before he left the head\nquarters? Did its contents trigger Wilson’s incredible rage,\ncausing him to swear out the warrant for England’s arrest?\nOne can only speculate. In any event, although England dis\nappeared, his letter survived—a revealing insight into the\ncharacter of Brother XII.\n\n206\nCHAPTER\nVIII\nBlack Magic in Court\nA\nt the Belvedere Hotel outside Victoria, snowflakes\ndrifted down from a grey sky, blanketing the former\nhunting lodge with white and gently filling up the sur\nrounding woods. Men with brooms knocked the snow off the\nwindshields of cars parked out front, while others carried arm\nfuls of firewood into the lobby. In the dining room, waiters\nset out cups and saucers and brought sandwiches and cakes\nto the long white buffet as the hotel guests assembled in the\nwarm interior to observe the ritual of afternoon tea.\nMary Connally had returned to the Belvedere after the\nassizes. She was grateful that the charge against Wilson had\nbeen dropped and that she hadn’t been required to appear in\ncourt on his behalf. But she wasn’t able to savour the victory,\nbecause he’d immediately called upon her to assist with an\nother crisis in the Foundation.\n“He was liberated,” she later recalled, “and I went down to\nVictoria and spent the winter. And I took charge of the woman\n\nBlack Magic in Court 207\nthat was very much in evidence during the trial, named Myrtle\n‘B.’ She was the one they talked about so much and tried to\nmake into so many headlines. She came to me in great distress\nand said that her name was ‘Jenkins.’”\nMyrtle Baumgartner’s mental state hadn’t improved\nsince she left Valdes Island—it may even have deteriorated.\nAccording to Mary, her condition was “deplorable,” and she\ngave the older woman a great deal of anxiety and cost her\nquite a bit of money, since Mary paid for Myrtle’s hotel bill at\nthe Belvedere.\nMary wasn’t able to rely on Wilson’s help either: “He came\ndown a couple of times to see her while she was there—three\ntimes,” she later said.\nMary was surprised to discover that Wilson also expected\nher to pay his legal bills. Earlier, she’d given Frank Cunliffe\nmoney to purchase \nThe Victoria Colonist newspaper, since\nWilson wanted to acquire a newspaper in order to further\nhis work. But the owners decided not to sell. When Cunliffe\nreturned the money to Mary, he informed her that he’d de\nducted his legal fees from the amount she had given him.\n“This was a surprise to me from two standpoints,” she re\ncalled. “First of all, that I was not consulted about it. And\nsecondly, that he hadn’t paid his bills after all I had done.”\nBut Mary put these thoughts aside and did her best to look\nafter Myrtle, accepting the additional financial expense phil\nosophically, since she had the means to do so. Yet she found\nthe experience at the Belvedere disquieting: “That was the\nfirst ripple I had of anything that was not quite in order to\nme.”\nAs the hotel staff prepared for the Christmas season and\nMary watched over the broken and pathetic figure of Myrtle\nBaumgartner, how could she not help but wonder if this trou\nbled interlude were not an ominous portent of the future?\nBrother XII couldn’t ignore the issue of his relationship\nwith Myrtle Baumgartner, since it continued to be a subject\n\n208 B R O T H E R X I I\nof controversy among the members of the Foundation. In\nspite of the explanation he’d given in his November General\nLetter, he’d still been attacked by Joseph Benner, who had vig\norously denounced him for his sexual misconduct, refusing to\nbelieve that he and Myrtle were initiates:\nRead what is said in reply to the fourth charge and note\nthe fact that no denial is made that the woman came and\nlived with him secretly, while he already had another wife at\nthe Center. Is anything said that this woman was induced\nto desert a loving husband, an invalid whom she had been\nnursing and caring for for months previously? Think you,\nif these were the two “Initiates” claimed, that the Great Law\nwould not have arranged it so that they would have come\ntogether in a perfectly natural way—by making each one\nfree to do their “mighty work” together, instead of by de\nceiving a wife and deserting a helpless husband? Think you\nGod or Initiates of the Great White Lodge work that way?\nOr that God would authorize the taking of both the Law of\nGod and the law of man into their own hands and bending\nthem to fit desire—no matter on how high a plane?\nMy Brothers, the serpent of sex is the most subtle and de\nceptive force in man’s nature. Wherever sex still lives and is\ngiven any prominence in the mind, it insidiously works to\nmaintain its power, and unless the heart has been purified\nby unselfish love, sooner or later it will bring havoc into the\nlife, and if encouraged and fed, will destroy the mind and\nbody, and almost wreck the soul.\nBenner told the members that to be a disciple, self and sex\nhad to be absolutely forgotten, since in “The Kingdom” they\ndid not exist: “When you have found The Kingdom and are\nabiding There, then and then only are you fit to learn the\nholy meaning of That which in human terms is called Soul\nMates or Companion Souls.” He claimed that Jesus Christ had\ntaught no such doctrine for the New Dispensation, and that,\n\nBlack Magic in Court 209\nas disciples, they could not enter the New Age that way:\n“Do not mistake, The New Age—The Age of Aquarius—is\nthe Age of Love, the Age of the heart and not of the head, and\n‘He who is to come,’ the Blessed Christ, must first have the\nfoundation of love laid for Him in the hearts and lives of every\none of his followers before He can come. The Age of Mystery,\nof Occultism, of Intellectual Knowledge, is passing. They must\nmake way for the clear Light of Truth in Love.”\nBrother XII wanted to settle the issue of his relationship\nwith Myrtle Baumgartner once and for all. Under the heading\n“A Personal Matter,” he addressed a General Letter to the\nmembership, replying to Benner’s new charges. He said he\nwanted the members to know the real facts, so they could all\nbe sure, in their own minds, that they weren’t being led into\nsomething opposed to the ideals of true morality:\nThat one whom he charges with desertion of a task\nmade, in the first place, a mesalliance. The circumstances\nof her life were desperately unhappy—it is not for me to\nstate the reasons, except to say that the fault was not on\nher side. For years she had nursed “an invalid husband,”\nbut if you knew the CAUSE of the invalidism, and the con\nditions under which the nursing was done, the whole case\nwould assume another aspect. The Good Law HAD worked\nto make each free. An entire separation had been agreed\nupon between those two before I had ever seen the lady\nin the flesh or knew that she existed. To say that she was\n“persuaded to come here” is utterly false. She decided to\ncome to this Center and to devote her life to this Work\n(either here or elsewhere) before I knew anything of the\nmatter. I did not know she was coming until three or four\ndays before her arrival, and I had never seen her physically\nin my life. When she did come, THERE WAS A MUTUAL\nRECOGNITION. Since 1922, we had worked closely on\ninner planes, and NEITHER KNEW THAT THE OTHER\nWAS IN PHYSICAL INCARNATION UNTIL THE\n\n210 B R O T H E R X I I\nMOMENT OF THAT MEETING.\nAnother point, and one that is important from the con\nventional standpoint, is this—the lady was a wife only in\nname, since early in 1925, she had never been anything\nmore than a nurse and attendant to the man whose name\nshe bore. In that year, she experienced very great things in\nthe spiritual world, and as a result of them, she was under an\nobligation to abstain absolutely from all ordinary contacts\nuntil the time came when her life work could be under\ntaken. This work, which Benner so sneeringly refers to, was\na matter of many years of intense inner training and prepa\nration—even as is my own.\nBrother XII dismissed Benner’s remarks about sex as typical\nof his moralizing attitude. He explained that his own teach\nings were for disciples, not for the masses of humanity. The\nincident with Myrtle was a special and unusual circumstance\nnecessary for the accomplishment of a particular work; it did\nnot point to a rule of conduct for all.\nBenner had accused him of bending both the law of God\nand the law of man to fit desire. He replied:\nWhat is law? Law is the aggregate of the CONDITIONS\nof sentient existence in A GIVEN FIELD of consciousness.\nThere is one law for the animal, another for man; one law\nfor the savage, another for the intellectual; there is the Law\nof the disciple, and the Law of the Initiate, and the Law of\nthe Adept or perfected man. Law is not a rule of conduct\nbut a condition of existence, and it varies with the range of\nconsciousness.\nThere is a wide difference between the man or woman\nwho has reached the (comparatively) lofty development\nrequired in the true disciple, and the rank and file of\nhumanity. There must therefore be a CORRESPONDING\nDIFFERENCE in the laws which rightfully govern these two\ndiffering stages of growth. The average man must be gov\n\nBlack Magic in Court 211\nerned by and submit to a law imposed from without. Why?\nBecause that law, in theory at least, represents “the greatest\ngood for the greatest number”; it is the corrective for self\nishness. The disciple must be governed by and submit to the\nLaw imposed by the Spirit or Higher Self upon the outward\nphysical man. Thou shalt keep the Law within thine own\nheart and within thy mind—the Law of thine own being.\nBrother XII also took the opportunity to clarify his views on\nmarriage. The essence of his teaching was simple, he said, and\nhe had no wish to make a mystery of it:\nThe case stands thus: TWO PERSONS SHOULD ENTER\nA DEFINITE MARITAL RELATIONSHIP ONLY WHEN\nTHE NATIVITIES (BIRTH HOROSCOPES) OF BOTH\nWARRANT THE UNDERTAKING OF SUCH A MUTUAL\nRESPONSIBILITY. The nativity is the chart of the Soul, as\nwell as of its outer garment—the physical body. In marriage,\nwe deliberately invoke (stir up) the powers and potencies of\nthe psychic and spiritual worlds—to do so ignorantly, or at\nthe instigation of a mere passing sexual attraction, is always\ndisastrous. The disciple must first KNOW THE LAW, and\nthen bring himself into voluntary and complete accord\nwith it. He differs from the masses of mankind in that he is\nself governed.\nIn closing, he stated: “Reason must control passion; the\ngood of the Race must ever come before mere personal incli\nnation. What we have come to declare is THE LAW OF THE\nILLUMINATI—of those disciples, Initiates, and Adepts who\nconsciously live the life of the inner world of Reality and are\ngoverned by its laws. They are no longer subject to the lesser\nlaws of men—they are the Children of Knowledge.”\nBrother XII’s letter was ironic, given Myrtle Baumgartner’s\npresent condition. But he couldn’t publicly acknowledge her\n\n212 B R O T H E R X I I\nbreakdown, since it was a persuasive argument in itself against\nhis assertion that the Work was proceeding according to plan.\nHis General Letter also contradicted the sworn testimony of\nRobert England that he’d met Myrtle on the train between\nSeattle and Chicago. Was he telling the truth or was his ver\nsion of events a deliberate falsehood? Whatever the case, he\nobviously did not wish to raise more questions than he could\nanswer.\nMyrtle’s breakdown, according to Annie Barley, was the\nresult of Brother XII’s mistreatment of her. Given his explo\nsive temper and vindictive nature, one can imagine the scenes\nthat might have taken place between them when he realized\nMyrtle would not fulfill her exalted destiny.\nMyrtle didn’t remain in Victoria for long. Before the year\nwas out, she was sent back to Toronto in the care of Louise\nHobart. After nursing an invalid husband, Myrtle was now an\ninvalid herself.\nDr. Edwin A. Baumgartner, a proud and wilful man, wasn’t\nabout to forgive his wife or take her back. He initiated divorce\nproceedings, sending a lawyer named Harold Potter all the\nway to British Columbia to obtain evidence. The divorce was\ngranted on grounds of adultery on September 1, 1931, in\nthe County Court in Canandaigua, New York. This is the last\nknown record of Myrtle Wells Baumgartner, whose love affair\nwith Brother XII and dream of becoming the mother of the\nnext World Teacher had led her to a pitiful and tragic end.\nr r r\nBrother XII’s disciples believed that as a member of the\nGreat White Lodge, he possessed the powers of an adept. He\ncould leave his physical body at will and travel in his spirit\nbody to any part of the world. He could enter locked rooms,\nlisten to secret deliberations, read sealed documents—\nnothing could be hidden from him. It was also believed that\nhe could wield powerful occult forces in his battle against\n\nBlack Magic in Court 213\nthe “Brothers of the Shadow,” the black adepts who were\ntrying to lead mankind astray.\nBrother XII had defined good and evil for his disciples as\nfollows: “‘Good’ is simply knowledge rightly applied; i.e., di\nrected towards the attainment of the ultimate goal set before\nhumanity. ‘Evil’ is the same knowledge wrongly applied, and\nleading through selfishness and greed away from that goal.”\nBut many of the disciples now suspected that Brother XII\nhad been possessed by one of the very adepts he’d warned\nthem about. Robert England’s clairvoyant vision of the “hel\nmeted and evil faced monk” standing a few feet behind\nBrother XII and inside his aura suggested this, as did the\nsinister black cowled figure “with a face like smoked leather”\nthat had been seen lurking near the House of Mystery by two\nof the disciples.\n“He was always talking about the black adepts and the\nwhite chelas,” Eric Davenport recalls. “One time, he was cit\ning an incident at a big convention he’d attended, and tell\ning us how the black adepts, as he called them, could disrupt\na meeting by sending out their vibrations against the speaker\nto make it so he couldn’t talk. They could paralyze him or\ngive him a heart attack or even kill him. The white chelas\nwould be battling these black adepts, trying to counteract\ntheir thought transmissions, these waves they sent out. It\nsounded like he was demented when he talked like this, but\nhe referred to these adepts all the time.”\nIf Brother XII possessed the powers he described to Dav\nenport would he use them against his enemies?\nThe answer came during Wilson’s preliminary hearing\nbefore Judge C. H. Beevor Potts. Though this particular in\ncident didn’t find its way into the official transcripts of the\ncase, Thomas P. Morton, the lawyer acting against Brother\nXII, was in the midst of addressing the court when he was\ninexplicably stricken. “He had some papers in his hand and\nall of a sudden, he started to shake and he collapsed on the\nfloor and lay there as if he’d been knocked out,” Victor B.\n\n214 B R O T H E R X I I\nHarrison recalled, “and a moment or two later, three or four\npeople sitting on the low bench which he had occupied col\nlapsed, some right on the bench, and two, I think, went over\nthe edge of the bench and onto the floor.”\nHarrison was astonished by what he’d just witnessed. “This\nis a very extraordinary performance,” he recalled thinking.\nAt that moment, Brother XII emerged from the audience\nand stalked across the police court floor. He approached\nHarrison and held out his hand to shake hands. “This is an\nawful state of affairs,” he said. “They’re trying to prosecute\nme, but there’s nothing in it, and you’re going to be appoint\ned by the Crown to prosecute this case at the assizes.”\nBrother XII’s prediction proved correct. “How he knew, I\nhaven’t the faintest idea,” Harrison later reflected. “He was a\nmost remarkable man.”\nThe lawyer rebuffed Brother XII’s conciliatory gesture.\n“Don’t talk to me,” he replied. “Go away. I don’t want to be\nbothered by you.”\nIn the midst of the confusion, Brother XII returned to his\nseat, while Beevor Potts attempted to restore order. Harrison\nrecalls that the shocked magistrate also succumbed to Broth\ner XII’s spell and that he “growled like a dog,” but managed\nto say in a rather shaky voice, “This court is adjourned.”\nThree weeks later, on December 6, 1928, during the\nJames Lippincott case, Brother XII again lashed out in court\nwith his occult powers. The former Foundation member was\nsuing Wilson for $450 in wages that he claimed was owed\nto him for his three months of work at the Mandieh Set\ntlement, though Brother XII maintained that Lippincott’s\nwork was voluntarily performed.\nLippincott’s most important witness was Coulson Turn\nbull, who’d made a special trip from Vancouver to appear.\nHe probably didn’t relish the prospect of testifying, since\nhe’d been badly shaken up by the note that Brother XII had\nleft for him at the Hotel Georgia threatening to disclose the\nmost intimate details of his private life and suggesting he\n\nBlack Magic in Court 215\ndisappear from British Columbia by the shortest route—off\nthe end of the wharf.\nLike Benner, Turnbull planned to continue the work of\nthe Aquarian Foundation, but in a new form. He believed\nthat traditional theology would be replaced in the future by\na religion based on myth, symbol and allegory. “I am now\nundertaking the most difficult task in this incarnation,” he\nwrote to one of his students in California. “I shall continue\nthe outer work in a series of monthly Instructions, ‘Letters\nof Understanding.’ I have been engaged in research work\ninto the ancient Egyptian Mysteries—this will come out in\nthe Instructions I shall issue.”\nBut Turnbull hadn’t impressed Lippincott’s estranged\nwife, Louise, who’d returned to Los Angeles after her claim\nagainst her husband had been dismissed. In a letter to Attor\nney General R.H. Pooley about her husband’s involvement\nin the Aquarian Foundation, she stated that Turnbull had\ncounselled Lippincott to reject marriage: “He wrote my hus\nband’s horo scope, telling him he should be free at any cost\nand many more things to urge him to leave me. He is a very\nbad man and goes to any length to further his own ends. He\ntold me himself that he knew Mr. L. was not just right, but\nrefused to help me.”\nLouise had nothing good to say about any of the Founda\ntion members: “This whole crowd, Mr. Pooley, are a bad lot.\nThe higher ups are simply preying on weak mental cases for\nper sonal gain. Wilson, England, Lucas—they’re all the same.\nIn fact, they did all they could against me. Therefore, I was\namused when I see Mr. Lucas claims all this trouble in the\ncult is over the ideas of marriage, etc. Not one of them be\nfore felt a married man had any obligation towards a wife.”\nJudge C. H. Barker called the court to order. Wilson was\nrepresented by Frank Cunliffe, Lippincott by Thomas P.\nMorton. On the stand, Lippincott testified that he’d built\na log cabin for Wilson on Valdes, and had generally been at\nhis beck and call, taking supplies to and from the Mandieh\n\n216 B R O T H E R X I I\nSettlement. He said Wilson had told him he’d pay him well,\nand had even promised him twenty five acres of land on the\nisland as a gift because he considered him one of his most\ntrustworthy followers. But whenever Lippincott had brought\nup the subject of wages, Wilson got angry: “He gave so many\ncontradictory orders that I couldn’t get along with him. Af\nter a row, we both expressed a mutual desire to quit.”\nWhen Cunliffe questioned Lippincott about his wife, Lip\npincott explained that he’d had trouble with her, that she’d\ntried to prosecute him, and that the case had been thrown\nout in the local courts.\n“As a matter of fact, you were in hiding from your wife?”\n“I was not.”\n“Didn’t you tell Wilson that you wanted to be on the island\nso that your wife couldn’t find you, and didn’t you receive a\nletter from Lucas telling you that you’d better come out and\ntake your medicine?”\nLippincott said he couldn’t remember.\nIn answer to another question, Lippincott acknowledged\nthat the Foundation wasn’t supposed to be a remunerative\norganization. He admitted that he hadn’t asked for wages\ninitially, and had turned over the proceeds from the sale of\nhis chart, “Astrology is the Clock of Destiny,” to the Society.\nCoulson Turnbull was sworn in. Since he’d been living on\nValdes during the time Lippincott was working there, his tes\ntimony was vital to Lippincott’s case.\nMorton asked Turnbull about the arrangement that had\nexisted between Wilson and Lippincott with respect to wag\nes.\nWhat happened next has been described by a number of\neye witnesses. The big astrologer was about to give testimo\nny for Lippincott when he started to tremble and suddenly\nfainted in the witness box, crashing to the floor with a groan\nand a thud.\nThe courtroom was in a pandemonium as his wife Cecilia\nrushed to the witness box to help her stricken husband. She\n\nBlack Magic in Court 217\nknelt over him as he lay on the floor, wrestling with an imag\ninary assailant. According to a reporter, she urged him to get\na grip on himself and repeatedly assured him that the “evil\nman” could not harm him.\nDr. Earl Hall was hastily summoned and applied smelling\nsalts to Turnbull’s nostrils. The astrologer revived and was\nslowly helped to his feet, before being taken out of the court\nroom.\nThe commotion gradually subsided and proceedings re\nsumed, but Turnbull did not recover sufficiently to return as\na witness.\nEdward Lucas was next to take the stand. He described\nLippincott’s work on Valdes, and said he’d heard Wilson\nstate on a number of occasions that he intended to pay the\nvarious individuals who had worked for him.\n“You wouldn’t say that Wilson’s conversation about pay\ning certain ones bound him legally?” Barker asked. Lucas\nreplied that he didn’t think it did.\nWilson then took the stand and denied that any contract,\neither expressed or implied, existed between him and Lip\npincott. He claimed that Lippincott had volunteered his ser\nvices, and reiterated that he was under no financial obliga\ntion to the plaintiff.\nFrank Cunliffe reviewed the case. He pointed out that Lip\npincott hadn’t asked for wages until after the crisis at the\nheadquarters and that the court had to prove that it was the\nintention of both parties that the plaintiff be paid.\nT. P. Morton stood up to summarize Lippincott’s case. He\nhad only just started to address the magistrate when he sud\ndenly halted his delivery in mid speech.\nJudge Barker looked at him quizzically, waiting for him to\ncontinue, but the lawyer simply stood there, immobilized,\nblinking in confusion as he tried to collect his thoughts.\nThe only sound in court was the embarrassed rustling of\npapers as the court staff waited for him to resume his legal\nargument.\n\n218 B R O T H E R X I I\n“This is ridiculous,” Morton finally stammered, “but I’ve\nfor gotten what I was saying!”\n“You were telling the court–” Cunliffe prompted him.\nMorton shook his head helplessly and shuffled back to his\nseat, baffled by the loss of his faculties.\nJudge Barker announced his verdict. Since there was no\nsig nificant difference between the evidence of Wilson and\nthat of Lippincott, and since the burden of proof was on\nLippincott, he would render judgment in favour of Wilson.\nBarker declared the court adjourned. Immediately, con\nversation erupted as everyone began to discuss Turnbull’s\ncollapse and Morton’s inexplicable mental lapse.\nWilson and his chauffeur, a burly Swiss named Walter Mill\ner, pushed through the crowd and exited the courtroom. As\nthey started down the courthouse steps, Miller stumbled and\nfell heavily down the steps, dislocating his shoulder.\nMiller was immediately taken to the Nanaimo hospital,\nwhile Brother XII was driven away by George Hobart.\nThe newspaper reporters quizzed the disciples for an ex\nplanation of the startling events that had just occurred. Al\nthough reluctant to talk, they admitted that they believed\nthe incidents, including the chauffeur’s fall, were caused by\nBrother XII’s occult powers, but that was as much as they\nwere prepared to tell the curious reporters.\n“TWO COLLAPSE IN COURTROOM,” proclaimed\nthe headline in The Province the following day. “DEFEN\nDANT WINS. TALK OF OCCULT POWER WHEN ACTION\nBROUGHT AGAINST AQUARIAN PRESIDENT.”\nBrother XII’s startling demonstration of his powers wasn’t\nlost on his followers, especially the ones who had broken\naway and feared his reprisals. Both Frederick Pope and Sid\nney Sprey Smith, who’d come out from England with the\noriginal party in the spring of 1927, took these latest events\nas their sign to leave.\nPope, the shy and effeminate interior decorator—he’d\nbeen nicknamed “Lucy”—had always wanted to escape. Ac\n\nBlack Magic in Court 219\ncording to Edward Lucas, Wilson had threatened to kill him\nif he ever tried. Nonetheless, one night under cover of dark\nness, Pope slipped away from the headquarters and made his\nway back to England.\n“Poor Fred!” Frances Lucas recalls. “I remember my father\nlaughing about it. He chuckled, ‘Fred ran like a frightened\nrabbit!’”\nSidney Sprey \nSmith also feared Brother XII’s retribution.\nThe bumbling and eccentric ex British Army captain took\nrefuge at Peggy Reynolds’s boarding house in Nanaimo. He\nstayed on there, unable to make the final break and return\nto England.\n“He was from a good family,” her daughter, Margaret Sal\nwyn, says. “He was educated at Sandhurst and had been an\nofficer in the army in India. But Brother XII had such a hold\nover him, he was terrified to leave. My mother had to buy\nthe ticket for him. Even then, he said to her: ‘What if The\nBrother wills the boat down!’ He really believed he had that\nmuch power.”\nThe day after the Lippincott case, Lucas and Cunliffe\nmet in Cunliffe’s office in the Imperial Building in Nanai\nmo to discuss a negotiated settlement to the dispute. Lucas\nexplained that Von Platen and DeLuce would submit their\nresignations as Governors of the Foundation if Wilson con\nveyed to them the registered titles to their property at Ce\ndar. Wilson was prepared to do this, Cunliffe said, but only\nif the Governors withdrew their petition to the government\nto have the Society dissolved. He also insisted they agree to\npublish a legal notice in the Vancouver, Victoria, and Nanai\nmo newspapers, announcing their resignations as Governors\nand disclaiming all interest in the Foundation. In addition,\nthey would be required to sign a quit claim in respect of any\npresent or future interest in the Society’s assets.\nThe next day, after talking over Wilson’s terms with Von\nPlaten and DeLuce, Lucas wrote to Cunliffe, advising him\nthat a negotiated settlement was impossible under the con\n\n220 B R O T H E R X I I\nditions they’d discussed: “Mr. Von Platen takes the position\nthat he has been grossly libelled all over America in the\nletters circulated by Mr. Wilson, and that the very least he\nshould do is endeavour to compel Wilson to carry out his\npledge that the Aquarian Foundation be dissolved.”\nLucas, who’d been hoping that the Society could be dis\nsolved voluntarily, was far from enthusiastic about having to\nspend more time and money on litigation in order to resolve\nthe dispute: “I guess we will have to put on our worn armour\nand hop into the fray.”\nr r r\nAt 11:30 on the morning of December 12, 1928, the mem\nbers of the provincial cabinet, led by Premier Simon Fraser\nTolmie, assembled in the executive chambers of the Parlia\nment Buildings in Victoria to hear the application to dissolve\nthe Aquarian Foundation. The cabinet members had already\nreviewed the evidence submitted with the petition; now they\nwould hear the arguments from the opposing sides. The tre\nmendous publicity given the Aquarian Foundation meant\nthat the government was being closely watched to see whether\nor not it would continue to sanction the activities of British\nColumbia’s most notorious religious cult.\nEdward Lucas spoke first. He argued that Wilson had vio\nlated the principles of the Society and wasn’t fulfilling the\npurposes for which it had originally been founded. He claimed\nthat Brother XII’s teachings represented a threat to public\nmorality and read excerpts from Wilson’s article on marriage\nto prove his point. He also read extracts from the numerous\nattacks Wilson had made in his published writings upon var\nious individuals, including Von Platen, Comfort, Benner,\nTurnbull, and Albert Smythe. Lucas accused Wilson of trying\nto start a religious war in the United States and of preaching\nanarchy in pursuit of his political goals. He pointed out that\nthe Society’s literature prominently stated that it was incorpo\n\nBlack Magic in Court 221\nrated by the province of British Columbia. Lucas urged the\ncabinet to intervene in order to stop Wilson from spreading\nhis insidious propaganda across America, and asked for the\nappointment of a receiver to take charge of the assets.\nFrank Cunliffe spoke against the application. He argued\nthat the legal grounds given in the petition were not sufficient\nto justify cancelling the Society’s charter, and that a forced\ndissolution of the Society would violate the rights of its mem\nbers. His client was not necessarily opposed to winding up the\nSociety, he explained, but wished to do so in a manner which\nwould protect the interests of all parties involved. Cunliffe\nstressed that where applicable, Wilson intended to return\nto the original donors the contributions they’d made to the\nSociety.\nCunliffe sat down and the subject of all the controversy rose\nto speak. Edward Arthur Wilson himself would present the\ncase for the Aquarian Foundation.\n“Gentlemen: in the matter of the petition for the dissolu\ntion of this Society now before this honourable Council, there\nare aspects of the greatest importance which must have much\nweight in your decision, but which we have hitherto had no op\nportunity of presenting. They are points which are concerned\nwith spiritual and moral values rather than legalities. They are\nnot only of great importance in this issue, they are to us by far\nthe most important aspects of this whole matter. Because of\ntheir nature, no legal counsel can present them. I alone and\nin person can do that, and I ask the opportunity of so doing\nbefore a decision is given by this honourable Council.”\nWilson told the cabinet members that although he stood\nalone before them, he was the representative of thousands of\npeople, that he pleaded their cause rather than his own in a\ncase that so dearly affected their happiness and well being.\n“The petition which has been made to this honourable\nCouncil \nis an instrument of untruth and wilful deception,” he\ndeclared. “The alleged grounds for its presentation are not\nthe real grounds, as I will presently prove. In itself, it is proof\n\n222 B R O T H E R X I I\nof the real characters and motives of the petitioners.”\nHe went on to describe the petitioners as “a band of trou\nble makers from Los Angeles.” He called Von Platen and\nDeLuce “alien immigrants of more than questionable charac\nter,” and Lucas “their hired tool—a man who has sold honour,\nsold loyalty, sold friendship, for a fee.” He accused them of at\ntempting to depose him in order to gain control of the Society:\n“This petition is, so far as they are concerned, a last resort; its\nobject is to bankrupt and destroy what they have failed to steal\nfor themselves.”\nIn proof of his charges, Wilson gave his own detailed ac\ncount of the events that had led up to the attack upon the\nWork. He claimed that the petitioners had neither equity in,\nnor any moral right to the assets of the Society. To support\nhis argument, he gave a brief outline of the history of the\nFoundation, explaining how he’d established the first groups\nin England and formed sections in Switzerland and several\nother European countries. He’d subsequently organized sec\ntions in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia,\nand New Zealand, and linked up scores of isolated mem\nbers in places as widely separated as West Africa, Egypt, India,\nBurma, and the islands of the Pacific.\n“I have written every book and every Instruction ever pub\nlished by this Society,” he declared, “and every article of\nimportance in \nThe Chalice magazine. In actual and veritable\nfact, I AM THE AQUARIAN FOUNDATION, and apart from\nmyself it has no plan, no driving force, and no existence.”\nWhat had the petitioners done to entitle them to any right\nor interest in the Society? he asked. “With one exception only,\nthey have made no material contribution beyond the small\nmonthly payments made by all members, though I am bound,\nin fairness, to acknowledge the legal assistance rendered to\nus by Lucas before he deserted this Cause for that of our\nenemies.”\nAny “rights” the petitioners might claim, he continued,\n\nBlack Magic in Court 223\nthey owed to himself alone, since it was he who had appointed\nthem and given them the opportunity to prove themselves in\nthe Work:\n“I have been accused by these petitioners of failing to adhere\nto the principles of our Order and of having made attacks\nupon certain individuals. In reply to those accusations, I would\nremind them of the words I wrote long since—‘We fight not for\nourselves, but for that which is committed to us.’ \nI have repudi\nated more than one attack and lying accusation made against\nthis Work. I have exposed the individuals who brought these\naccusations against us, even as I will expose these petitioners\nthemselves for what they truly are. Beyond such personal ref\nerences as are necessary to the defence of this organization, I\nwill make no personal defence. I have in all things a clear con\nscience—I have no need to make defence.”\nWilson told the council that the Aquarian Foundation was\nan organization dedicated to the uplifting and betterment\nof humanity. He reminded the cabinet members that he’d\ngiven them petitions and written evidence from hundreds of\nmembers of the Society who repudiated the action of the peti\ntioners, and that the stigma which would fall upon the Society\nif the petition were allowed would affect many thousands of\nearnest and sincere souls.\n“Gentlemen, in the interests of equity and true justice, I\nclaim that these thousands have a right to consideration, that\ntheir voice should be heard. If the scales of Justice are to weigh\nwith impartiality and righteousness, then the weight of their\nCause must be thrown into the scale. They appeal to you that\nyou shall not allow the greed and fear of these conspirators to\ninflict upon them a grave injustice and a deep distress.”\nFinally, Wilson reiterated that the claims of the petitioners\nwere a mere legality. He concluded:\n“It is still my intention to dissolve the outer Society myself,\nbut under such conditions and in such a manner as shall not\nsubject it to the rapacious plunderings of these petitioners.\nI am more anxious to be rid of them than they are of me,\n\n224 B R O T H E R X I I\nand if every other measure fails, I will myself petition this hon\nourable council to effect its dissolution at such time and upon\nsuch conditions as shall ensure justice for the membership of\nthis Society as a whole, and in every part of the world.”\nPremier Tolmie thanked Wilson for his presentation, and\nassured him the cabinet would consider the facts in the case\nvery carefully and reach a decision as quickly as possible. The\nfate of the Aquarian Foundation now rested in the hands of\nthe British Columbia government.\nr r r\nIn the spring of 1928, Thomas Smith, a thirty six year old\nbusinessman from Hollywood, California, arrived at the\nAquarian Foundation headquarters driving a brand new green\nand black Oldsmobile roadster. Smith’s wife had recently\ndivorced him after only three months of marriage, claiming\nthat he had threatened her with bodily injury, was insanely\njealous, bragged to her about his improper relations with\nother women and had caused her to have a nervous break\ndown. Smith showed Brother XII letters of credit worth ten\nthousand dollars and was invited to join the group at the\nheadquarters. The other members were not so easily im\npressed—with his deadpan face and coarse manner, Smith\nwas generally considered to be a repulsive character.\n“I thought he was a horrible man,” Margaret Salwyn recalls.\n“He’d been in World War I, and I heard him telling my grand\nmother: ‘Men, women, or children; it made no difference—I\ncould take a drink of water afterwards and forget it!’”\nSmith’s hobby was oil painting. He fancied himself an\nartist and soon became a familiar figure at Cedar by the Sea,\nperched in front of his easel, painting the landscape. But he\nonly stayed at the headquarters for a few months; at the begin\nning of the summer he moved to Victoria, to the great relief\nof everyone at the Center.\nIn Victoria, Smith met a twenty two year old movie ush\n\nBlack Magic in Court 225\nerette named Gladys Barlow at a high school dance. He asked\nher out, and the two were soon seeing each other nearly every\nday, driving around Victoria in Smith’s automobile, going to\nparties and the beach, and parking in secluded spots at night,\nwhere they engaged in heavy petting. The relationship was\ndefinitely physical, but was never consummated. Gladys re\nfused Smith’s demands for intimacy and rejected his proposal\nof marriage. At the end of the summer, she broke off the ro\nmance and Smith returned to Los Angeles.\nThree months later, Smith returned to Victoria, determined\nto see Gladys again. He’d already sent her an engagement\nring, which she refused to accept, leaving it at the Customs\nHouse in Victoria. Smith telephoned and begged to see her,\nthreatening to kill himself if she refused. Gladys went out with\nhim two nights in a row. On the third night, on the pretext of\ntaking her to see a friend, Smith drove her to an unfurnished\nhouse in Oak Bay, which he’d rented that morning. When\nhe pulled into the overgrown lot beside the dark and vacant\nhouse, Gladys immediately suspected something was wrong.\nShe got out of the car and started to run towards the street,\nbut Smith caught up to her, dragged her back to the house,\nand pushed her through the front door, snarling, “I’m going\nto get you tonight!”\nIn the bedroom, he threw her down onto a bare mattress\nand started pulling off her clothes. “I’ll kill you!” he said, “and\nI’ll kill myself—and maybe that is the best way!” Gladys tried to\nscream, but Smith clamped his hand over her mouth. “You do\nlove me, don’t you!” he said. Gladys shook her head. Smith in\nsisted she tell him she loved him. “What is the point of saying\nit?” she protested. Smith’s hands closed around her throat:\n“Never mind, I want to hear you say it!” Panic stricken, Gladys\ntold Smith she loved him. He then forced himself upon the\nterrified girl.\nWhen it was all over, Gladys picked up the scattered pieces\nof her clothing and dressed. She followed Smith into the\nliving room, where he lit a fire and played some gramophone\n\n226 B R O T H E R X I I\nrecords. In a bizarre engagement ceremony, he then slipped\na cheap diamond ring on Gladys’s finger. Fearful of pro\nvoking him, she pretended to be flattered by his attentions.\nAfter planning the details of their wedding, Smith told her\nhe wanted to drive back to her parents’ house and announce\ntheir forthcoming marriage.\nSmith drove Gladys home. As the pair walked up the side\nwalk together, Gladys pointed to a rose bush and asked Smith\nto pick her a rose. When he stopped to pluck it, she rushed up\nthe front steps and into the house. Locking the door behind\nher, she screamed to her parents, \n“Don’t let that man in! He’ll\nkill me!” Smith ran back to his car and quickly drove off.\nThe following morning, Constable Frederick Boyt of\nthe B.C. Provincial Police noticed a man answering Smith’s\ndescription standing on the CPR wharf in Nanaimo waiting\nfor the 6:00 A.M. ferry to Vancouver. After questioning him\nand examining the contents of his car, Boyt arrested him on\na charge of rape. Smith was returned to Victoria under police\nescort to stand trial.\nSmith’s arrest made headlines in the Victoria and Nanaimo\nnewspapers. The reports identified him as a former member\nof the Aquarian Foundation who still owned property at\nCedar. This publicity linking one of Brother XII’s followers to\nsuch a sordid incident couldn’t have come at a worse time for\nWilson, just as the cabinet was in the middle of making its de\ncision about the Foundation’s future.\nCyril F. Davie, a Vancouver Island lawyer and member of the\nlegislature, had been lobbying the cabinet on Wilson’s behalf.\nHe advised Frank Cunliffe that he’d been unable to influence\nthe cabinet members in light of “a recent development con\ncerning a young girl, now in the charge of the police, whose\nunfortunate condition the police allege to be traced to the\nAquarian Foundation.” Davie said he couldn’t speak to the\ntruth of the charge, but “the alleged immorality of the whole\naffair is so strongly entrenched in the minds of the cabinet\nthat it became useless for me to labour any further argument\n\nBlack Magic in Court 227\nagainst the dissolution.”\nr r r\nAs the year 1928 drew to a close, many commentators confi\ndently predicted that Brother XII’s career was finished. Henry\nStokes, editor of \nThe Oriental & Esoteric Library Critic, published in\nWashington, D.C., reviewed the peculiar events in his article, “The\nBrother XII Bubble Bursts.” Commenting on the Osiris Isis con\ntroversy, he observed sardonically, “Whether there was an effectual\nguarantee that the proposed son Horus would not be a daughter\ndoes not appear.” Stokes believed that the entire episode was a\nuseful example of the dangers facing the unwary spiritual seeker:\nSome of the members may have learned a salutary lesson;\nothers being born suckers will continue to be such, and will bite\nat the next bait offered. There are many who cannot resist the\nallurements of persons, be they men or women, possessed of\nself assurance and of a commanding or persuasive mien, who\nthink, or pretend to think, that they are in communication with\nbeings on a higher plane, especially when they clothe themselves\nin garments of light and back up their assertions with ancient\ntruths, but always implying, “I am a new Messenger.” It is worth\nthinking over by others than those of the Aquarian Foundation.\nStokes was nevertheless intrigued by Brother XII:\nIt is not my business to diagnose the character of the Brother\nXII. Was he simply a shrewd imposter who finally overplayed his\npart? Was he really convinced, as many another is, of the reality\nof his mission and of his psychic revelations, and did he finally\nfall a victim to them, finding an excuse in the idea that he was\nthe god Osiris incarnated? Was he, as has been maintained, the\nvictim of the “Dark Forces”? Was he simply a fool beguiled by a\nwoman? These are interesting questions which may be left to his\nfollowers to settle. . .\n\n228 B R O T H E R X I I\nMeanwhile, it appears certain that the Brother XII has signed\nhis own death warrant, and as he alone was the supposed link\nbetween the Masters and the White Lodge, the affair will go to\npieces and leave not a wrack behind. . .\nBut Stokes, like many others, seriously underestimated Brother\nXII. The strange career of the retired English sea captain was not\nover yet.\nr r r\nThe British Columbia government was looking into the legal\nimplications of dissolving the Aquarian Foundation. H.M. Garrett,\nthe Registrar of Companies, advised the Attorney General that\nthe Society’s objects were perfectly legitimate and that dissolving\nit because of its political or religious tenets would be a mistake. He\npointed out to Pooley that if the Society were dissolved, its assets\nwould revert to the Crown, but that such an action would be a novel\nprecedent and perhaps a dangerous one.\n“In my opinion,” Garrett concluded, “the only grounds on which\nit would be proper for the Lieutenant Governor in Council to act\nis the decency or not of the Society’s operations—whether or not\nit is an immoral organization. Even so, there is nothing to prevent\nWilson from reorganizing the Society on an unincorporated basis\nand doing the same thing again. It seems to me that, if possible,\ncriminal proceedings should be instituted.”\nEdward Lucas was growing impatient awaiting the government’s\ndecision. He had expected an announcement within days of the\nhearing. The weeks passed and there was still no word. He finally\nwrote to the Attorney General, asking what was causing the delay.\nHe urged the government to act quickly in the matter, observing\nsomewhat bitterly that “Mr. Wilson, of course, is carrying on his\nwork both at Cedar and at Valdes Island, and is proclaiming by cir\nculars that his work for the emancipation of humanity has been\nsuccessfully established.”\n\n229\nCHAPTER\nIX\nCity of Refuge\nB\nrother XII’s new tugboat, the Khuenaten, cast off\nfrom the dock below Nanaimo’s Malaspina Hotel and\nheaded out into the busy harbour. The little coal town\nquickly faded into the smoky haze as the fifty horsepower\nFairbanks-Morse diesel propelled the sturdy vessel out past\nProtection Island and the bare rock of Gallows Point. The salt\nspray fell hissing into its wake as the tug rounded Jack Point\nand headed south into Northumberland Channel, towards its\ndestination of Valdes Island.\nIn the first three months of 1929, Brother XII had resumed\nwork at the Mandieh Settlement, transporting supplies there\nwith the Khuenaten and rapidly building up the colony. The\ngovernment still hadn’t announced whether or not it would\ndissolve the Aquarian Foundation, but he was continuing his\nwork regardless. On this particular morning in April, he was\ntaking Mary Connally to Valdes to show her the progress that\nhad been made at the new settlement. With Walter Miller at\n\n230 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe helm, Brother XII and Mary could stand in the bracing\nair of the tug’s open afterdeck and drink in the magnificent\nbeauty of British Columbia’s Gulf Islands.\nThe Khuenaten moved east, beneath the massive sandstone\ncliffs of Gabriola Island. Entering False Narrows, it swept\npast the floating kelp beds that lined the shores of Mudge\nIsland, discharging their pungent aroma into the salty air.\nBuilt over the winter in Victoria, the forty-foot tugboat had\nalready proved its worth, hauling supplies to Valdes in the\nroughest winter conditions. The exact derivation of the name\nKhuenaten isn’t known, but Brother XII may have named his\ntugboat for the Egyptian god of water, Khnoom—the moist\npower. Or perhaps he chose the name in honour of the\npharaoh Akhenaten, the religious reformer and mystic with\nwhom he strongly identified.\nEmerging from False Narrows, the \nKhuenaten headed across\nPylades Channel towards the rocky ramparts of Valdes Island.\nThis coastline had been explored in 1791 \nby the Spanish cap-\ntain Don Cayetano Valdes, but thousands of years earlier,\nsome say, King Solomon’s navies had sailed here all the way\nfrom Africa in search of gold, their crimson sails billowing in\nthe wind. Gliding through the swirling waters of the pass be-\ntween Cordero Point and Josef Point, the \nKhuenaten headed\nsouth along the foreshore, slipping in behind the rocky shelf\nof Kendrick Island, its sandstone ledges home to nesting cor-\nmorants. In a tiny bay known locally as Dogfish Bay, the tug\ndropped anchor and Brother XII rowed Mary ashore.\nA trail led up from the pebble beach into the forest. Salaal\nand sword ferns crowded the path, and other trails branched\noff to cabins nestled in the underbrush where individual col-\nonists had chosen to build. After a ten-minute walk, the trail\ncame out into a large open area that faced the Strait of Georgia.\nThere was a thick carpet of moss underfoot and the granite\noutcroppings were covered with lichens. The sounds of ham-\nmering and sawing echoed across the clearing as carpenters\nframed up an assembly hall and other workers constructed\n\nCity of Refuge 231\nlog cabins in various locations around the clearing. Under a\ntarpaulin that flapped in the breeze, the women of the colony\nprepared lunch on a large cast-iron stove. Setting down their\ntools, the workmen seated themselves on either side of a long\ntrestle table, digging hungrily into steaming platters of food.\nAfter Brother XII escorted Mary around the settlement, he\nled her to his house, a five-room log cabin at the top of the\nridge.\nInside the comfortable interior, tea was served from a table\nset with fine linen and Limoges china. Brother XII explained\nto Mary that the Mandieh Settlement would now be called\nthe Brothers’ Center, after those Masters of Wisdom or Elder\nBrothers who were behind the Work. He’d decided to change\nthe name because of the unfavourable publicity the colony\nhad received, but its purpose remained the same: the settle-\nment would be the actual physical location where the Elder\nBrothers would incarnate, bringing a new spiritual impulse\nto mankind and giving instruction to the selected individuals\nwho would take part in the work of restoration succeeding the\nbreakup of the existing order. All this was fully explained in\nThe Brothers’ School, a paper he issued to prospective disciples,\nwhich outlined the requirements for admittance:\n“True discipleship means a life dedicated to the service of\nhumanity; it is diametrically opposed to the preferences of\nthe personal self. No compromise between these two is pos-\nsible. Therefore, the first requirement is THE SURRENDER\nOF PERSONAL POSSESSIONS, an actual not a theoretical\nsurrender. If the disciple is truly dedicated, it follows that all\nhe has is included in the dedication of himself. This is the first\nrequirement and it constitutes at once a safeguard and a test\nwhich the insincere will be unable to face.”\nThe Brothers’ Center would be a self-contained spiritual\ncommunity, independent of the outside world. Individual\nmembers would be able to surrender personal possessions\nbecause all the needs of the body—food, clothing, and\nshelter—would be provided for. By putting away the attrac-\n\n232 B R O T H E R X I I\ntions and allurements of the world, the disciple would, at\nthe same time, have loosed from his shoulders the burden\nof its problems and anxieties. Provisions would come out of a\ncommon fund, and all buildings or cabins put up would au-\ntomatically become the property of the community. Cabins\nwere expected to be simple and unpretentious, avoiding non-\nessentials. Crops would be cultivated, and everyone would be\nexpected to help in the general work and to comply with the\nrules and requirements necessary to ensure harmony.\nThe applicant to the Brothers’ Center had to be prepared\nto completely surrender all other interests and activities: “The\ndisciple must be ready to ‘live the life,’ a life of service and de-\nvotion to one end. None may live this life in part and the life\nof the outer world in part. The bars have not been let down\nbecause we have come into the Western world. Had you es-\nsayed to come to us in Tibet or elsewhere, all that would have\nbeen taken for granted. Only the gold of pure and unselfish\ndevotion will pass the test.”\nBrother XII declared that perhaps one person in a million\nwould be able to fulfil the conditions for entry: “The real oc-\ncultist is born, just as is the musical genius, the artist, or the\nTeacher.” In answer to the question, “Who may qualify?” he\nreplied: “THE CHILDREN.” These would be born to faithful\nmembers of the group, he explained, and would be raised in\nan environment conducive to their development, away from\nthe spiritually devastating conditions of the outside world:\n“The effects of eighteen or twenty years of ordinary training\nare so terrible from a spiritual standpoint that they perma-\nnently disable all but those rare souls, the born Servers of the\nRace, and even these are hindered to a degree.” Brother XII\ntold Mary that the formation of the Brothers’ Center was an\nevent of great significance.\nLater that day, Brother XII and Mary travelled in the\nKhuenaten southeast from Valdes across Pylades Channel to\nthe DeCourcy group of islands, which lay at the north end of\nTrincomali Channel. The soft sandstone cliffs of the islands\n\nCity of Refuge 233\nhad been eroded into strange shapes by the wind and waves,\ngiving the shoreline an eerie, moonlike quality. The Indians\nwho had inhabited these islands had buried their dead in\ncrevices that ran deep into the rock. Brother XII explained to\nMary that there was a deserted farm in the center of DeCourcy\nIsland that had good soil; if it could be made operational, it\nwould provide the colony with all the food it required. He\ntold her that these islands, lying directly between Cedar and\nValdes, were strategic. If the Center could acquire them, it\nwould have a self-contained unit of property, and members\nwould be able to come and go as they pleased, free from out-\nside interference.\nThe \nKhuenaten carefully negotiated the narrow channel\nbetween the long spines of rock guarding the entrance to\nthe lagoon at the south end of DeCourcy. This lovely spot\nwas known locally as “The Haven.” The waves lapped gently\nagainst the warm sandstone and all around the lagoon, the\nfoliage rose up rich and luxuriant. The staccato chatter\nof kingfishers filled the cove. At the head of the bay, the\nemerald-green waters shone jewel-like in the sun. Brother XII\nexplained to Mary that he wanted this idyllic sanctuary to be\nthe new headquarters of the colony.\nMary was seduced by the beauty of the islands and by Brother\nXII’s vision of the future of the Work. Returning to Nanaimo,\nshe arranged to purchase DeCourcy and Ruxton Island, the\ntwo largest islands in the DeCourcy group, comprising 669\nacres, from the estate of Nanaimo pioneer William Minter\nFlewitt, for the sum of ten thousand dollars. Mary put the title\nin the name of Brother XII’s Secretary-Treasurer, Thomas\nCranmer Williams, rather than in her own name.\n“I wished my name kept out of it,” she later explained.\n“There’d been so much talk and notoriety, and my family\nhadn’t known anything about what I had done, and I didn’t\nwant them to know. The deeds were made out to Thomas\nCranmer Williams to keep anything from being known.”\nA few weeks later, Mary left British Columbia for California.\n\n234 B R O T H E R X I I\nBut the acquisition of the DeCourcy Islands meant that Brother\nXII could proceed with his plans to expand his work. He now\ndevoted his full attention to establishing his new colony, an\nisland kingdom set amidst the spectacular natural beauty of\nCanada’s Pacific coast.\nr r r\nA number of members of the Aquarian Foundation who\nhad remained loyal to Brother XII through the recent crisis\nnow arrived to take up permanent residence at the Brothers’\nCenter. They included a commercial artist named Herbert\nJefferson and his wife, Dora. The Jeffersons had been the sec-\nretaries of a Toronto group, but upon receiving Brother XII’s\ninvitation, they sacrificed their house for a fraction of its value\nand boarded the train for Vancouver.\n“He always insisted that he be paid in gold,” Jefferson re-\ncounts. “Before I left Toronto, a woman who was a very keen\nmember said to me, ‘Now, Brother, I want you to take this\nmoney and give it to Brother XII.’ There was about five hun-\ndred dollars in gold, so I bought a money belt that I wore\naround my waist, and put these gold pieces in it so they\nwouldn’t get stolen. I handed it over to him when I got there,\nbut he never invited her out. Ha! She was fanatically attracted\nto the movement, but she never received an invitation!”\nThe Jeffersons were met in Nanaimo by George Hobart,\nwho’d known the couple in Toronto. During the drive to\nCedar, he told them how disappointed he was with life at the\ncolony.\n“He said to me, ‘Bert, the whole thing is a wash-out! It isn’t\nwhat we thought it was!’” Jefferson recalls. “He was sorry he’d\ncome out in the first place, but he said to me, ‘Here I am, and\nhere I’ve got to stay. I’m just going to make the best of it!’ That\nwas the first thing that struck me—that people who had gone\nout early on felt as if they’d been sold down the river.”\nThe Jeffersons were now in much the same situation as\n\nCity of Refuge 235\nHobart. They’d left their old life behind, so when they arrived\nat Valdes they turned over the little money they had brought\nand joined the community.\nJefferson and his wife were required to sign a paper de-\nclaring that they were there as guests, not employees, and that\nall work they performed was voluntary. This way, Brother XII\nensured that no legal claim could be brought against him for\nwages or any other compensation.\nJefferson, who was forty-six years old at the time, was as-\nsigned to a work crew, cutting a trail across the island from\nthe West Bay to the site of the main settlement. Brother XII\nplanned to eventually widen this trail into a road, so that he\ncould truck supplies directly across the island. Jefferson was\nunaccustomed to hard physical labour—his usual job was\ndrawing illustrations for the Eaton’s mail-order catalogue—\nbut, like Hobart, he resolved to make the best of the situation.\nHe worked hard and enjoyed the strong feeling of camara-\nderie that existed among the men.\nBrother XII gave him another job, building a fence across\none section of the property to stop the sheep that belonged to\nhis neighbour to the north, an elderly widow named Amelia\nWake, from straying onto his land. “He sent a note to her,\nsaying, ‘If you don’t keep your sheep out, I can be a bad neigh-\nbour, too,’” Jefferson says. “I thought it was quite uncalled\nfor!”\nHe remembers that one day Brother XII accidentally\ndropped a cigarette end into a wastepaper basket and it burst\ninto flame. He managed to put it out, but the incident trig-\ngered Brother XII’s fear of fire. He had Jefferson scrape up\nand cart away all the moss from the rocks surrounding his\nhouse so there would be no chance of it catching fire.\nJefferson and his wife were both keen students of meta-\nphysics. Like many of the disciples who’d accepted the\ninvitation to Valdes, they expected there would be more in-\nstruction than there was, even though Brother XII had written\nthat the Brothers’ Center was not a school of classrooms\n\n236 B R O T H E R X I I\nor of books, but a school for the soul. The occasional talks\nthat he gave were excellent, but they didn’t always satisfy his\naudience.\n“Once he was very good,” remembered Jefferson,” and\nDora said, ‘Oh, Brother, just go on a little further and explain\na bit more, and then I’ll have got something really definite!’\n‘No,’ he said, ‘I can’t—I can’t say any more.’ And he wouldn’t\ngo on, and that was quite disappointing.”\nFor Jefferson, it was the small incidents that served to illu-\nminate Wilson’s character, rather than the grandiose claims to\nknowledge he might make:\n“Dora used to cook for us,” he recalls. “One day, she was\nin the pantry when she heard footsteps behind her. When\nshe turned, there was Brother XII taking a dozen eggs out of\nthe cupboard. ‘We haven’t any eggs,’ he said. ‘I thought I’d\njust borrow these.’ Dora said, ‘Well, these people here have\nbought these eggs with their own money. They’ll miss them,\nso will you please return them?’ ‘Oh, I will, Dora!’ he said, ‘I\nwill!’ But that was sneaky of him—to come and take a carton\nof eggs. He returned them, but he wouldn’t have if she hadn’t\nbeen there.\n“Every week or so, we’d send to Mac & Mac’s in Vancouver\nfor our supplies. He’d go down to the boat, look at what had\nbeen brought in and pick out what he wanted. If he needed\na carton of cigarettes, he’d take it. Tom Williams would ask,\n‘Where are my cigarettes?’ Brother XII would say, ‘Oh, Tom,\nI took them. I was out of cigarettes. You put in for another\ncarton next time.’ He hadn’t ordered them, he hadn’t paid\nfor them—but the poor sucker that had ordered and paid for\nthem never got them!”\nOne day, Jefferson and another worker were sent by Brother\nXII to DeCourcy Island to clear some land. He dropped them\noff on the island with a thermos of tea and some sandwiches\nand said he’d pick them up that evening. But he never showed\nup at the appointed time. The two men found an old well\nfor drinking water, dug for clams, and slept in the deserted\n\nCity of Refuge 237\nfarmhouse, battling hordes of hungry mosquitoes. Three days\nlater, Brother XII remembered he’d left them on the island\nand returned in the \nKhuenaten to pick them up.\n“All these jobs he gave us to do were tests,” Jefferson ex-\nplains. “He’d say, ‘Now, you’ll be tested. I’ll give you something\nto do which may appear to be hard for you, or unreasonable,\nbut this is my way of testing you. When you come through with\nflying colours, then you’ve passed your initiation and you’re\nready for further work.’”\nSo Jefferson stayed on at the Brothers’ Center and tried\nto “live the life” of discipleship, even though he’d concluded\nfrom his own observations that the Master, in his own daily\nlife, wasn’t living up to the high standards he expected of his\ndisciples.\nAnother new arrival at the colony was Gertrude Phillips,\nthe widow of a U.S. congressman and a former feature writer\nfor \nThe Washington Post and The New Orleans Picayune. An\nastrology columnist for The San Francisco Examiner, Gertrude\nhad patented a system for charting the horoscope, Astrology:\nThe Scientific Basis of Prophecy\n. After her husband’s death,\nshe devoted much of her time to social work, and hoped to\nmeet in the Aquarian Foundation people with ideals similar\nto her own. Inspired by Brother XII’s writings, she’d already\nmade several large contributions to the Work before arriving\nin Nanaimo on June 6, 1929, to take up residence at the\nCenter:\n“He met me at the Malaspina Hotel and he was very cor-\ndial,” she related. “And he asked me at once at the hotel how\nmuch I had brought. Before this, he had written to me to sac-\nrifice all I could, realize all the cash I could and bring it in. I\ntold him I hadn’t been able to bring so very much, but that I\nhad stock which I had arranged to sell. Stock was up then, so\nI expected to realize a large sum on it. I told him I would turn\nit into the Work, and he was very much pleased.\n“The next day, I went with him on the tug, and the woman\n\n238 B R O T H E R X I I\nwhom he’d introduced as his wife accompanied us on the\nboat. She called herself Elma Wilson—and they were not good\nfriends at all. They spoke very sharply to each other.\n“We arrived at Valdes and he lived in a comfortable house,\nin the front yard of which there was a tent. I had to live in the\ntent. There was no heat and it was very uncomfortable. He\ntold me I had to live there until I could build a house.\n“Then he asked me if I could cook for some of the men\nwhose wives hadn’t come. He said they were very much over-\nworked. When I saw these young men that were so wet and\ntired and overworked, I was glad to cook for them. The cook\nstove was out at the back, and I could hear him and this woman\nquarrelling violently most of the time—everyone could hear\nit. He was cursing and it was simply terrible. It shocked me.\n“One day, he came down to my tent with a letter. He sort\nof confided in me because I had been a welfare worker and\nhe thought perhaps I would understand. He read this letter\naloud to me. He said it was from Myrtle ‘B,’ and that before I\ncame, she had lived in one of the cottages on Valdes. He said\nshe was his soul mate and that she went insane. He told me\nthat she had had two miscarriages, then he sent her away. And\nhe said, ‘I am now sending her two hundred and fifty dollars,’\nas she was begging him for money.\n“And then I asked him, ‘Can our Work afford it? Are we\nto give money to everyone we send out?’ And he said, ‘Mary\nConnally has given us the money to buy this island of Valdes\nfor our Work. She is very rich. She is worth about three mil-\nlion. In fact, we have plenty of money to use.’\n“And I remember when we went into town, he wore a grey\nsuit. He asked me what I thought of his clothes. ‘Don’t you\nthink I ought to dress better now?’ he said. I asked him if that\nwas his best suit. He said, ‘Yes, I was a poor man when I came\ninto the Work. I had nothing to bring in except my brains and\nthe work of my hand.’\n“Another time, I had to come to Nanaimo to cash some\ncheques. He brought me over on the tug. We went past\n\nCity of Refuge 239\nDeCourcy Island, and he showed me a nice little harbour\nthere. He pointed it out, that it was a good harbour. I said,\n‘What a pity we don’t have a harbour on Valdes. We very much\nneed a harbour.’ He smiled and said, ‘This is our harbour.\nMary Connally has given the money to buy these islands for\nour Work. This is really our harbour.’”\nr r r\nA sinister figure, who would become a major force in the\nlife of the colony throughout its latter days, now entered the\npicture. Mabel Skottowe was a thirty-nine-year-old redhead\nwith a harsh voice and an abrasive manner. She was adept\nat manipulating men and using her feminine charms to get\nwhat she wanted. Born Edith Mabel Rowbotham in Lancashire,\nEngland, in 1890, she’d emigrated to Canada with her parents,\nsettling on a farm outside Lemsford, Saskatchewan. Her father\nbecame a prosperous farmer and later a Justice of the Peace.\nMabel taught school for ten years in places like Battleford,\nBroadway, Eagle Hills, Lancelot, Macoun, Marengo, Novar,\nZealandia, and other small prairie towns. On New Year’s day\nin 1918, she married John Coulson “Percy” Skottowe, a brash\nand boastful former North-West Mounted Police constable,\nwho was manager of the Union Bank of Canada at Lancer.\nWhen he was fired from the bank for a shady loan scheme he\ndevised, the couple moved to Seattle, where Skottowe worked\nas a clerk for a steamship company. In 1926, the marriage\nbroke up and Mabel went to Florida to live with Skottowe’s\nfather, Reverend John Coulson Skottowe, the Episcopalian\nminister of Saint Katherine’s Church in Pensacola. Considered\na nonconformist by his congregation, Skottowe was a strict\nvegetarian, taught reincarnation, and was regarded as a\nmystic. The author of Religious Brevities for Those Who Think, he\nundoubtedly influenced Mabel, who had always been an\nardent student of the occult. At some point, she adopted\nthe letter “Z” as her mystical name, the significance of which\n\n240 B R O T H E R X I I\nremains a mystery.\nIn Florida, Mabel met Roger Painter, the owner of a whole-\nsale poultry business that grossed over a million dollars a year.\nLong-haired, bearded and saturnine, Painter was known as\n“The Poultry King of Florida.” He was a former stage hypno-\ntist with a penchant for magic and the occult. He was also a\ncompulsive womanizer; he’d been married five times and had\ncarried on numerous affairs. He and Mabel were drawn to\neach other, entering into a stormy love affair. In 1927, the two\nbecame the divisional secretaries of the Aquarian Foundation\nfor Florida. They remained loyal to Brother XII throughout\nthe crisis with the Governors, and in the spring of 1929 they\nreceived an invitation to come to the headquarters in British\nColumbia.\nBy this time, Painter had already been making regular con-\ntributions to Brother XII, who often wrote asking for money.\nPainter would promptly send a cheque for five or ten thou-\nsand dollars or more. He kept no track of the amount he gave,\nbut when he left Florida, he turned over his poultry business\nto his brothers and went north with ninety thousand dollars in\ncash to give to Brother XII.\nFrom the beginning, the two new arrivals were in a dif-\nferent league from Herbert Jefferson or Gertrude Philips, or\nindeed from any of the other new arrivals. Brother XII rec-\nognized them as fellow “Brothers” destined to play a major\nrole in his future work. Mabel Skottowe was Brother III, and\nRoger Painter was Brother IX. After the defection of the\nother Governors, each of whom was to have been the phys-\nical channel for the energy of one of the twelve Brothers of\nthe White Lodge, Brother XII needed to find other suitable\nindividuals to fill the vacancies. In any case, their arrival was\nan event of major importance, sealed for good measure when\nPainter turned in ninety thousand dollars to the Work.\nBrother XII claimed to have known and worked with Painter\nin a past life. He wrote to Mary Connally: “To me there has re-\ncently come a Brother whom in the past I knew and worked\n\nCity of Refuge 241\nwith as John de la Valette—after whom the old town of Valetta\nin Malta was named. We have renewed old memories and are\nnow cooperating in the work I have outlined.”\nJean de la Valette was the first Grand Master of the Knights\nof Malta, one of the most powerful religious orders in Europe\nduring the Middle Ages; he had heroically defended Malta\nagainst the Turks during the Ottoman siege of 1565.\nOn the rugged windswept shores of Valdes Island, far from\nthat era in time and place, Roger Painter, true to Brother XII’s\nrecollection of their shared past, had a vision of an island in\nthe Mediterranean and a long road winding down from the\nmountains. Down this road on a hot afternoon, a long train of\nKnights in plumed helmets, their swords and shields glinting\nin the sun, moved steadily towards one central point—the an-\ncient city of Valetta on the island of Malta.\nIn the same letter, Brother XII explained to Mary the signif-\nicance of this historical period to their own work:\nIf you have an opportunity, secure and read a good his-\ntory of that period, and especially anything dealing with the\nKnights of Malta or the Knights Templar. It is true that you\nwill only be able to get the \nshell of those great endeavours,\nbut even at that it will be interesting and instructive reading.\nIf you read between the lines, you will be able to understand\nsomething of the purity of their aspirations and the selfless-\nness of their devotion to their Order. Histories are biased\nand politically controlled, and if you remember that the last\nvestige of that Order was suppressed about the close of the\neighteenth century by interested governments, you will un-\nderstand that history will surely pass over their virtues and\nenlarge upon their defects. The point is this—the Knights\nare gathering again; \nthey have come into incarnation to take\nup their place in the line of battle we are forming. Many are\nscattered through the ranks of Freemasonry, and through\nthem, working with us, that Order will soon receive a new\nlife and a great purifying.\n\n242 B R O T H E R X I I\nBrother XII also spent a great deal of time with Mabel\nSkottowe. The growing attraction between the two soon\nbecame apparent. Painter brooded about it, his past-life link\nwith Wilson no proof against jealousy, while Elma went about\nher chores tight-lipped. It was obvious the two were about to\nbecome lovers.\n“She had a tent in the bush,” Herbert Jefferson recalls.\n“We’d be in bed about ten-thirty at night, and we’d hear him\ngoing to her tent. He’d leave late that night or else early the\nnext morning.”\nA few days later, the colonists heard screams from Mabel’s\ntent and ran to help her. They rushed up in time to see Roger\nPainter burst out of the tent, shaking with rage, and dart off.\nInside the tent, they found Mabel, brutally beaten.\nBrother XII banished Painter from the colony. The “Poultry\nKing” returned to Florida, consoling himself with a new mis-\ntress, twenty-three-year-old Leona Siever. Painter continued\nto correspond with Brother XII, however, waiting to be sum-\nmoned back to the colony.\nElma fled to a sympathetic friend in Vancouver—the same\nMrs. Reynolds who had run the boarding house in Nanaimo.\n“I heard my mother open the door,” Margaret Salwyn recalls,\n“and Elma Wilson fell into her arms in tears. ‘How could he\ndo such a thing!’ she sobbed. ‘After all these years—to think\nhe’s really like this!’”\nBrother XII was unmoved by Elma’s grief. In a letter to Mary\nConnally, he mentioned that “Elma is very probably going to\nSwitzerland in the near future, as I have a request for help\nfrom that section which she is very excellently fitted to answer.\nAlso, she feels that an entire change will be a very good thing\nfor her.”\nIn the same letter, he also referred to Myrtle Baumgartner:\n“There is no possibility that ‘M’ will ever be able to come out\nhere again. The rule seems to be inexorable that in this Work,\nif one once fails, there is no recovery in this incarnation. That\nis so in the instance to which I refer and \nI know it.”\n\nCity of Refuge 243\nWith Elma conveniently occupied elsewhere, Mabel Skot-\ntowe now moved in with Brother XII. She became his personal\nsecretary, taking dictation, typing letters, and advising him\non the day-to-day running of the colony. She may even have\ncollaborated with him on a book he announced was in prepa-\nration at this time, \nThe Law of Cycles and of Human Generation.\nThe advertisements for this work, apparently never pub-\nlished, ascribed its authorship to “Two Brothers of the Twelfth\nHierarchy.” In any event, Brother XII came to rely on Mabel’s\njudgment, and made her the foreman in charge of the work\ndone at the colony. Mabel instructed the disciples to call her\n“Madame Z” (using the American pronunciation “Zee,” with\nthe accent for “Madame” placed on the first syllable) and even\nhad her table napkins monogrammed with a large “Z.”\n“She was very feminine and very clever at handling men,”\nHerbert Jefferson remembers. “She was an adventuress, really.\nShe took charge of him and jolly well made sure she got what\nshe was after—money and power. They each helped each\nother to a lower life—in a respectable way, but nevertheless\nit was a lower life. She was ‘bad medicine’ and corrupted the\nwhole concern—but she was pretty deep.”\nThe disciples soon discovered that Madame Z, a tireless\nworker herself, was a harsh task-mistress. She was impatient,\nshort-tempered, and carried a riding crop or quirt, which she\ndidn’t hesitate to use when her temper got the better of her.\nMany of the disciples resented her interference in the affairs\nof the colony, but they had no choice but to obey her. Brother\nXII made it clear to them that he considered Mabel his co-\nworker, with authority equal to his own. If she told them to do\nsomething, it was the same as if he’d given the order himself.\n“She is my eyes, she is my ears, she is my mouth,” he declared.\n“Her orders are my orders. Whatever she says, you are to take\nas coming from me.”\nWith Madame Z at the helm, Brother XII had time to devote\nhimself to various domestic projects he was eager to complete.\n\n244 B R O T H E R X I I\n“Have done such a lot of work since you were here,” he wrote\nto Mary Connally. “You would not know the log house—all\nstained inside and a garden fenced. I formed beautiful soil by\ndraining that little slough, and I shall plant many things next\nweek. . . Valdes is developing by leaps and bounds—many\nhouses up and many people coming in. Excuse this hurried\nscrawl, but am perpetrating it just before going to bed. All\nsend you their love.”\nHe also had Alfred Barley do some astrological work for\nMary, adding his own interpretation to the chart: “Venus\n(in this progressed figure) is in the twelfth house, house of\noccultism \npar excellence, and Uranus is in the tenth, and so\ndignified and very powerful. I take this to mean that you will\ncome into your own, indeed that you have done so in respect\nto your relations with the Lodge and all it stands for. Knowing\nthis, it will not be difficult to suffer outer ills gladly if need be,\nfor they are of small moment when weighed in the balance\nwith the Realities.”\nMary responded by sending Wilson a number of beautiful\ngifts, such as a blue glass vase and stand, and a pair of silver\ncandlesticks, which he mentioned in another letter: “I have\nat last straightened up my room, indeed the whole house on\nValdes, so that you would not know it. The teapot and the can-\ndlesticks have a shelf all to themselves, and the lotus box is\non a small table in the center of the big window with the blue\ncloth under it. All my books are fixed on a good shelf, so now\nthe place is fit to live in. Love to you from all here, and COME\nBACK SOON.”\nMary owned 160 acres of property in the San Bernardino\nValley in California, which Brother XII believed would be an\nideal spot for a southern center for the Work. On June 17,\n1929\n, while staying in Reno, she made a further contribution\nto the cause, deeding the property to him for the sum of ten\ndollars.\nBrother XII was delighted to receive the deed. He immedi-\nately wrote to thank her and told her about the progress they\n\nCity of Refuge 245\nwere making on DeCourcy: “Have had the hay cut and stacked\nin the barn—a splendid crop. Dick Nicholson is enthusiastic\nover the ranch and says he has never seen such a splendid soil\nor such really wonderful possibilities anywhere else. The old\nhouse will have to be \nburned down, as it is very much over-run\nwith live-stock, ‘almost walking away’ as Nicholson says. One\ncould not even use any of the lumber, so it is best to burn it\nand salt down the site.”\nAt the same time, he informed her of a major new develop-\nment he planned for DeCourcy Island, explaining that an\nimportant decision had been made at a recent conference of\nthe Brothers of the Twelfth Hierarchy:\nIn order to carry forward this Work into its next stage\n(which will have a bearing on the world situation), certain\nof our Brothers now in incarnation need to have a cen-\ntral residence from which to work, and in which they may\nenjoy that retirement from outer world contacts they need.\nDeCourcy is exactly adapted to that purpose. It has there-\nfore been decided that I build “Greystone,” and I have the\nplans already worked out. It will be a large place—two re-\nception rooms, six or seven bedrooms, three bathrooms,\ngood entrance hall, etc. The servants’ wing will be on one\nside of the house, while my own quarters will be in a sepa-\nrate wing, and so be quiet and private, consisting of a library,\nbedroom, dressing room, and bathroom. . .\nI have chosen the land immediately behind and running\nup from the middle of the three bays at the south end. The\nground slopes easily and has the right aspect, and there is\nplenty of foliage (oaks, maple, and arbutus) for a shelter\nagainst the wind from the south-east, and also for a screen\nof privacy. The beach is good and there is ample water at no\ngreat depth. . .\nYou will be glad to hear the news, for I know you love\na dignified house. Also, the erecting of this one house at\nonce will double the value of the property. If you will also\n\n246 B R O T H E R X I I\nbuild a good house on or near the site of the old house in\nthe center of the island, we would have an estate that would\nbe worth—even from the point of view of real estate—not a\ncent less than sixty thousand dollars.\nHe told Mary that this mansion would be built out of the\ngranite found on DeCourcy Island. It would have a slate roof\nand walls of dressed stone, five feet thick. He said it would take\nhim a year to build, but he hoped to get the materials on the\nsite by the end of the summer.\nMary was pleased to hear that DeCourcy would be virtually\na private estate for their own residences, and that she would\nhave a place of honour beside him. “In fact,” she later re-\ncalled, “if I had been inclined to be selfish about it, it would\nalmost look as if I had bought DeCourcy for my place and his\nplace.”\nThe plans for Greystone coincided with another of Brother\nXII’s concerns at this time—his search for a successor. Since\nMyrtle Baumgartner’s miscarriages, he had resumed his\nsearch for a child—not his own—who he believed would suc-\nceed him, and who had already been born some years earlier.\nGreystone would also be the residence, he wrote Mary, “of the\nOne who will be in charge of this Work in the near future.\nNeither I, nor He who will come after me, can long continue\nin the kind of quarters I now occupy.”\nIn several issues of \nThe Chalice in 1928, Brother XII had\nadvertised for this child. Under the headline “IMPORTANT,”\nhe explained that a male child had been born July 19, 1917,\nat 5:20 A.M., somewhere in the United States or Canada, but\nprobably in the Midwest, between thirty-five and forty-five\ndegrees north latitude and at one hundred degrees west lon-\ngitude. He urged the parents of any child born on that date to\ncontact him, since this child was destined to play an important\nrole in the future work of the Aquarian Foundation.\nCoulson Turnbull’s birth chart for the child showed him\nto be a soul of great dignity, poise and self-reliance, one who\n\nCity of Refuge 247\nhad incarnated with exceptional mental power and purpose.\n“We find him to be a fine mathematician, keen scientist, an\nastrologer, an artist, and a very warm-hearted soul, all neces-\nsary for a leader,” Turnbull observed. “‘He will draw all men\nunto Him.’” He noted that Pleiades on the cusp of the elev-\nenth house indicated the protection of Higher Intelligences\nand showed that “the mission of this soul will be a well guarded\none.” Turnbull advised his students to work out the twenty-\nninth and fifty-ninth years’ directions, the latter falling in the\nyear 1975.\nThe search for this child had puzzled Edward Lucas. In the\nmargin of \nThe Chalice, next to Turnbull’s interpretation of the\nchart, he made a note: “This boy is said by E.A. Wilson to be a\nbody he is preparing for himself, and will take charge of at the\ndeath of his present body, yet he doesn’t know where the boy\nis now—queer, isn’t it?”\nBrother XII even asked Mary Connally to assist him in\nlocating the child: “Do not forget the search I asked you to un-\ndertake. The time is speeding, and \nvery much depends upon\nmaking that contact without delay.”\nA few months later, however, he wrote again, telling her\nhe’d decided to postpone the search for the time being,\nuntil he had more time to concentrate on it. He would build\nGreystone first. “First the nest, then the Bird,” he joked. “‘But\nyou wouldn’t call \nthat guy a bird, would you?’”\nr r r\nEach month, Brother XII wrote a general letter to the disci-\nples, giving his teaching on a variety of subjects relating to the\nWork. The letters were subsequently published in London,\nEngland, by L.N. Fowler and Company under the title Unsigned\nLetters from an Elder Brother\n. Their purpose was to help the dis-\nciples make the transition to a higher state of consciousness.\nBrother XII told them that it was not only possible for them\nto take this step, it was inevitable. They only needed to decide\n\n248 B R O T H E R X I I\nto apply themselves to the task and to let knowledge direct\ntheir effort. This is why contact with a Teacher was of supreme\nvalue:\nThe disciple who is dimly aware of the existence of the\nworlds of Reality is like a small ship upon an ocean; in all\ndirections he is surrounded by the illimitable; beyond his\nsmall horizon lies the unknown. His own efforts may be\ncompared to the winds which drive his vessel forward, vari-\nable in force and direction. What is his first requirement?\nHe must be able to steer a straight course. Chart and com-\npass and rudder are essential to success; without them he\nwill be driven in every direction at the mercy of every wind\nthat blows. The chart is prepared by others who have al-\nready made the journey and are familiar with those regions\nand conditions which the voyager seeks. The compass is\nwithin yourself—it is the compass of Intuition. The rudder\nis the rudder of your own Will; you must keep a firm hand\nupon the helm so that the buffeting of wind and sea shall\nnot deflect you from your course. Of themselves, neither\nhopes nor aspirations will avail you; knowledge alone can\nbring you to the port of your desires.\nBrother XII stated in the \nLetters that the first requirement\nof a disciple was that he or she be reborn in a spiritual sense.\nOnce this spiritual birth had taken place, the enclosing walls\nof personal concerns would have forever fallen away, and the\ndisciple could live consciously in the world of Spirit: “Love,\nemotion, experience, life itself, all these will be seen in a newer\nand truer perspective; you will view and understand them from\nthe mountain peaks of reality instead of, as heretofore, from\nthe weary and flattened plains of illusion. Life for you will no\nlonger mean the few brief and perhaps empty years which lie\nwithin the span of one short incarnation, for you have now\nentered consciously into a life that is endless and eternal; you\nhave only to realize the fact.”\n\nCity of Refuge 249\nThis same birth was also taking place in the life of the race,\nhe explained: “This our Era is both the ending and the begin-\nning of an Age; all who are born in it are part of it, are factors\nin the total sum, grains weighed in one or other of its scales.\nIt is a period of birth for the Race as a whole —humanity may no\nlonger be carried in the womb of ignorance and darkness;\nthe hour of birth is upon them. It is not a Saviour of men that\nshall be born, but Man himself.”\nBrother XII also tried to give a sense to the disciples of how\ngreat and vast was the work upon which they were engaged. It\nstretched back many thousands of years, he said, explaining\nthat in all ages, every great work had been accomplished by\na small group of souls under one especial leader. This same\ngroup of souls incarnated again and again to carry forward\nthe work to which they were dedicated:\nThe commencement of our present effort and associa-\ntion goes back a long way—to the time when a certain Ruler\nof ancient Egypt withstood the corrupt and materialized\npriesthood of that day and did restore a knowledge of the\nTruth to the hearts and minds of men. He was Himself one\nof the divine Initiates, and in that life it was necessary that\nHe should wield the authority of a great Ruler if the work\nwas to be done. “The Invocation of Light” was one of the\nproducts of that earlier striving.\nBetween that day and this there have been many efforts,\neach varying with the needs and circumstances of the age\nwhich called them forth, but always “for the destruction\nof evil-doers and for the sake of firmly establishing righ-\nteousness,” we—you and I—have striven. In the present\ntime, two efforts are, in a special sense, taken up again and\ncarried forward. The first of these I have already referred\nto; it was the overturning of the state religion of Amon-Ra\nby the pharaoh of that day, Amenhotep IV, who changed\nhis name to Akhenaten, by which name he is known to histo-\nrians. The Restoration of the Mysteries, and of that divine\n\n250 B R O T H E R X I I\nknowledge which underlies them, and which is again to be\nmade known to men, is the fruit of that earlier Restoration.\nAnother and much later work accomplished by this same\ngroup, and many who joined with us in that struggle, links\nus with Europe in the Middle Ages—a period of spiritual\ndarkness almost unequalled in history. I refer to the work\nof the Knights Templar with their various degrees and as-\nsociate Orders. That effort, or series of efforts, came in a\nperiod when Europe was under the feudal system of gov-\nernment; it was an attempt to purify and uplift it, to restore\nto it a spirit of devotion to the service of others and that\nsense of \nresponsibility in government which originally charac-\nterized it. . .\nToday, you will find these brothers of ours scattered\nthrough most of the modern orders, and especially are\nthey to be found in the ranks of Freemasonry. Most of them\nhave not yet realized the truth with regard to themselves,\nbut they have an intuitive sense of a change—imminent\nand desirable. Almost immediately the trumpet-call will be\nsounded for these, and—they will awake and remember:\nThrough their efforts the ranks of Freemasonry and other similar\norders will know a great Renaissance.\nBrother XII also claimed in Unsigned Letters that many\noutstanding religious figures from the past were part of the\nWork:\nRemember that the physical embodiments of a Regent\nare practically continuous, and that many notable lives or\nhistorical characters are, in reality, but the work of the one\nlife or Consciousness. I will give you an instance—Moses,\nSamuel, Elijah, Daniel, John the Baptist, and Saint Paul\nwere physical embodiments of THE REGENT OF THE\nMANU. Note how the qualities of leadership and judg-\nment characterize them all alike, how they arraign the evils\nof their day, how they exhort, drive, compel, build and re-\n\nCity of Refuge 251\nbuild, and in the end—establish. Moses said, “Ye are the\nSeed of Abraham”; St. Paul said, “Ye are children of one\nHousehold” (Hierarchy); and I say unto you—“Ye are mem-\nbers of one Brotherhood.” It is the same teaching and the\nsame Work.\nA constant theme in Brother XII’s letters was the coming\ncollapse of the social order. Three months before the October\nstock market crash, he wrote:\nOften we are asked—“When will this destruction be?” and\nmy reply to you is—It has already commenced. Beneath the\nnote of a camouflaged “prosperity” so loudly sounded in\nthe public press, the big operators, the financiers and those\nwho are in key positions see already the terrific cracks and\nfissures in the economic and financial bases upon which\nthis artificial civilization is up-reared.\nConsider past history and you will find that whenever the\nhour has struck for the downfall of a nation, a group of na-\ntions, or an order of civilization, it is brought about \nby the\ncrumbling of that upon which it is raised. \nThe glory of ancient\nEgypt was brought low by the corruption of her religious\nlife—a slow process but in the end inevitable. The downfall\nof Rome came with the destruction of her military power,\nsapped by an effete luxury. This also was a slow process but\nequally sure. The overthrow of a great system of religions\noccupied some thousands of years; the destruction of the\nmilitary power of the Roman Empire was spread over some\ncenturies. In both cases, the superstructure was compara-\ntively solid and enduring; also, in those days, events moved\nslowly.\nConsider now upon what the civilizations of modern\nnations rest, what is that foundation upon which they are\nbuilt. They are builded not upon the faith and beliefs of\nnations, not upon military or naval power, but upon some-\nthing so flimsy, so intangible, that even a rumour causes\n\n252 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe whole to perilously sway. THEY ARE BUILT UPON\nCREDIT. Consider also that events in this age are not slow-\nmoving; they rush upon us with a fierceness of haste and a\nprecipitancy that is bewildering. Know therefore that this\ncompletion of downfall which in Egypt took some thou-\nsands of years, and which engulfed the Roman Empire after\nthe passage of some centuries, shall sweep away the present\norder \nin a few short months from the time of the first great\ncrash. . .\nBeware the first light puffs which presage the coming\nstorm, the trickle of pebbles and small rocks which precede\nthe landslide. It is but a few weeks since five banks smashed\nin one district in Florida in one day, and some of our own\npeople suffered greatly thereby. Things are not as secure\nas they may appear. Do not be deceived by great buildings\nor the massed traffic of city streets; remember rather their\nflimsy under-pinning and how their very weight and num-\nbers are chief factors in their destruction. The greater the\nmass, the greater the panic when it starts. It is the large cen-\nters of population that will be a shambles because \njudgment\nwill strike at the heart of the evil.”\nBrother XII told the disciples that the present work was one\nof preparation. They were laying the foundations of the new\norder which would succeed the present: “We have to form the\nnucleus of that order which, Phoenix-like, is to arise from the\nashes of the tempest of destruction we foresee.” He used the\nexpression “City of Refuge” to describe the colony, and pre-\ndicted that within a very short time, it would become a center\nof safety in the midst of chaos:\n“We are building a City of Refuge, and it has to be built \nbefore\nthe break; we have to get food, stores, tools and implements,\nraw materials; we have to build, to make roads and landings,\nto clear and to cultivate, and we have to do this work and to\nobtain these supplies now, while we are able to get them.”\nHe asked the members to make a special sacrifice in order\n\nCity of Refuge 253\nthat the work could be accomplished in time. And to each\none, he sent a “Card of Recognition” inscribed: “Labour in\nthis Vineyard, and thou shalt eat of its fruit. Build thou the\nCity of Refuge; it shall hide thee in the Day of Adversity.”\nr r r\nMary Connally, meanwhile, was in Washington, D.C. for the\nhearing of a lawsuit she’d filed against the Southern Railroad\nCompany. She contended that the smoke and cinders from\nthe railroad’s shops in Biltmore, where it had built a round-\nhouse, had seriously damaged the potential of her estate\nat Fernihurst for residential development. She was suing\nSouthern Railroad for $250,000, one of the largest claims filed\nin the federal court in Asheville at the time. The suit had sub-\nsequently been transferred to the district court in Washington,\nD.C. The entire railroad community in the United States was\nwatching the proceedings. If Mary won a large settlement,\ndozens of similar claims, aggregating in the millions of dol-\nlars, were expected to be filed.\nBrother XII was very interested in the case and advised\nMary at length about it. He predicted: “You will not gain all\nyou hope, but will nevertheless make some gain.”\nThe proceedings opened on August 5, 1929, in the U.S. dis-\ntrict court in Washington, D.C. For ten days, the testimony of\na procession of witnesses, including Southern Railroad offi-\ncials, bank executives, Asheville realtors, railroad employees,\nand local residents, was heard. With so much at stake, the evi-\ndence was fiercely contested. After the last witness had stepped\ndown, the jury withdrew to consider the verdict.\nThe morning of the eleventh day, Mary took her seat in\ncourt. Pale but composed, she listened while the foreman of\nthe jury announced the verdict: damages to the plaintiff of\none cent. The jubilant Southern Railroad officials congratu-\nlated their lawyers. Mary sat stunned by the decision. Her own\nlawyer moved to have the judgment set aside, but the judge\n\n254 B R O T H E R X I I\noverruled the motion and ordered Mary to pay the costs of\nthe action.\nBrother XII reacted to the news with less than philosophical\ncalm. “I got a letter from him,” Mary recalled, “telling me that\nI was doing absolutely the wrong thing, and acting absolutely\nin the wrong manner, and that I was absolutely responsible for\nlosing my lawsuit, although I had all his instructions as to what\nto do and how to do it.”\nBrother XII evidently thought better of his initial response\nand wrote again to “Lady Mary,” expressing his regrets. He\nadded that the decision about whether or not to appeal must\nbe her own, based upon competent legal advice. He also urged\nher to return as soon as possible to British Columbia:\n“You have been through a terrific jam this summer and you\nneed to get right away from it all. . .You need peace and quiet,\nand a chance to rest, and think, and grow. . .\n“Concentrate on settling up outside business and on re-\nturning quickly in order to take up that life which is yours in\nReality.”\nSummer faded into fall, and on DeCourcy Island, Brother\nXII proceeded with his plans to turn the island into the new\ncenter of his activities. He had some preliminary clearing\ndone of the site he planned for Greystone, as well as a road of\nsorts made down to the water. He also continued to rehabili-\ntate the farm in the center of the island, since he planned\nfor it to eventually supply the needs of everyone at the three\nsettlements of Cedar, Valdes and DeCourcy. In addition, he\nfinished construction of his house in the lagoon at the south\nend of the island. It stood on a grassy bluff overlooking the\nentrance to the bay. On the opposite shore, he planned to\nbuild several houses for the select few who would comprise\nthe inner group that would live near him. This entire area,\nknown as the Point, became the new headquarters of Brother\nXII’s operations.\nIn the last week of September, Brother XII and Madame\n\nCity of Refuge 255\nZ moved over to DeCourcy. Delighted to be installed in the\nnew house at last, Wilson wrote to Mary: “The home is indeed\na ‘haven,’ and I am so busy getting all my affairs in running\norder.”\nBrother XII’s move to DeCourcy marked a definite change\nin his relationship with his disciples. He advised Mary that he\ncould no longer “mix in” as before, and that he had to “with-\ndraw myself almost entirely from \npersonal contact with any of\nthe people here.” The retreat was not for selfish reasons, he\nexplained. It was a necessary part of his occult work.\nBrother XII claimed that this seclusion was the right of\nevery adept in physical embodiment. In connection with it,\nhe quoted from \nLight on the Path: “‘It is part of His inherit-\nance, part of His position. He has an actual title to it, and can\nno more put it aside than the Duke of Westminster can say he\ndoes not choose to be the Duke of Westminster. . . Unless pro-\ntected and made safe, Their growth would be interfered with,\nTheir work hindered. The Neophyte may meet an Adept in\nthe flesh, may live in the same house with Him, and yet be\nunable to recognize Him, and unable to make his own voice\nheard by Him.’”\nBut there was another reason for his seclusion. He explained\nthat he was working with a ray of tremendously powerful spir-\nitual force—the Sixth Ray or Red Ray. It would be focused\nthrough him as its appointed agent in the outer world; as a\nresult, it would be dangerous for the disciples to visit him or\nto approach unbidden:\n“This seclusion is necessary, not only for the work of the\nAdept, but FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO OTHER-\nWISE WOULD COME INTO PERSONAL CONTACT\nWITH HIM. This Ray will heal and enlighten and uplift that\nwhich is attuned to it, BUT IT WILL DESTROY that by which\nit is opposed. . . My advice to all who are unacquainted with\nthe nature of the Red Ray and the laws which govern its opera-\ntions is—stay out of the Powerhouse.”\n\n256 B R O T H E R X I I\nAt the Brothers’ Center on Valdes Island, the disciples were\ngrowing disgruntled. They felt estranged from Brother XII\nbecause of his retreat, and many still objected to the harsh\nrule of Madame Z. The hard work, too, was taking its toll. A\nnumber of the disciples began to quietly set aside money from\ntheir fifteen dollars’ monthly allowance, towards the day when\nthey could leave the colony.\nSomehow, Brother XII became aware of the situation and\nacted promptly to put down the insurrection. On October 11,\nhe made a special trip to Valdes and summoned the disciples\ninto the assembly hall. Herbert Jefferson was among the anx-\nious group who faced him.\n“I want each one of you to declare whatever money you’ve\ngot, up to a dollar,” he announced. “I have an idea that some\nof you are holding back!”\nOpening the Bible, he dramatically read the account of\nAnanias and Sapphira, who had tried to deceive the Apostle\nPeter by withholding money from the sale of their land:\n“‘But Peter said, “Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart\nto lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of\nthe land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? And after\nit was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou con-\nceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men\nbut unto God.”\n“‘And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up\nthe ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these\nthings.’”\nBrother XII finished by recounting the fate of the wretched\nSapphira, who had also lied to the Apostle: “‘Then fell she\ndown straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the\nyoung men came in, and found her dead, and carrying her\nforth, buried her by her husband.’”\nBrother XII’s performance had the desired effect. The\ndisciples came forward and surrendered the money they’d re-\ntained. Herbert Jefferson declared thirty-five dollars, although\nother disciples declared much larger amounts.\n\nCity of Refuge 257\nBut both Jefferson and his wife, Dora, thought Brother XII’s\nattempt to intimidate the disciples was a disgrace. At the end\nof the meeting, they told him they wanted to leave the colony.\nThomas Cranmer Williams and his wife also told Brother XII\nthey didn’t wish to remain.\n“He was nice to me, mind you,” Jefferson recalls. “He said to\nme, ‘I think you’re making a mistake, but you’re free to go any\ntime.’ He let me use the \nKhuenaten to transfer my personal ef-\nfects to Vancouver, which he didn’t have to do. Afterwards, I\nwrote him a letter to thank him. I was very careful what I said.\nI didn’t heed the temptation to denounce him. I simply said\nthat we’d had a rich experience—that was the way I put it.”\nJefferson regards Wilson as a fraud, but a brilliant one, with\nan extraordinary grasp of spiritual matters:\n“He was quite an attractive character until you got to the\ninner man—then you saw what a rotten person he was. He\nwas a pretender; in that sense, he might be called—in a slight\nway—a lord of the underworld, but not beyond that.\n“All of his disciples were under his hypnotic spell, but only\nfor a time. When you got away from him and saw the thing as\nit really was, you saw at once how false it was—and how his pre-\ntences were all just ‘boogie woogie’!”\nBrother XII was pleased with the results of the meeting. He\nwrote to Mary Connally that there had been a “big clean-up”\non Valdes Island: “On Valdes, the whole atmosphere has been\ncleared up, and we have at last gotten it clear and free from\nseparateness, and from petty personal planning. At last, we\nare able to commence to really build (in an inner sense) that\nenvironment which is intended. There has been some elimi-\nnation there. Should it always work that way, for \nit is impossible\nthat the wrong spirit or the wrong attitude can long remain\nhidden. The vibrations of our work are powerful: they are so\nthat that which is opposed to it is inevitably drawn up to the\nsurface and cast out.”\nBrother XII informed Mary that she could now have the\nhouse on Valdes vacated by Thomas Cranmer Williams and his\n\n258 B R O T H E R X I I\nwife as a temporary residence before she moved to DeCourcy.\nShe’d be comfortable on Valdes, he assured her, and could\ntemporarily store her belongings in a storeroom at Cedar.\nAt the same time, he told her about Bruce and Georgia\nCrawford, a young couple who had recently arrived from\nLakeland, Florida. The Crawfords owned a small dry cleaning\nbusiness, and had brought their life savings of five thousand\ndollars to the colony. Brother XII described them to Mary as\n“two beautiful souls who are almost purely sixth-race in type\nand outlook,” and said they’d be willing to give her all the\nhelp she needed:\n“They are quite young, and we call them ‘the children.’\nI know you will love them, and they you. They have been\nthrough a great testing since coming here, not in one, but in\na hundred different ways, and they have come out with flying\ncolours. Bruce will help you in any way you need in fixing the\nhouse and getting settled, and he will look after the wood, etc.\nfor you, and love to do it.”\nMary began winding up her affairs and preparing to return\nto British Columbia. She decided not to appeal the railroad\ncase. In the midst of packing, she wrote to Brother XII, asking\nwhat she should—or shouldn’t—bring.\nHe encouraged her to bring whatever she wished, despite\nthe restriction laid down in \nThe Brothers’ School paper against\npersonal possessions. “By all means,” he wrote, “bring your\nbathroom fixtures and everything else you can, seeing that\nyou are having a car (railway) to Vancouver.”\nr r r\nAlmost a year had passed since the petition to dissolve\nthe Aquarian Foundation had been heard by the provincial\ncabinet. The government had decided to let the two parties\ntry to reach a negotiated settlement, but the bitterness and\nmutual recrimination that existed between Brother XII and\nthe other Governors had sabotaged every attempt. Finally, on\n\nCity of Refuge 259\nNovember 15, 1929, the cabinet passed an Order-in-Council\ndissolving the Society. Attorney-General Harry Pooley ex-\nplained to reporters when he made the announcement that\neach landowner at Cedar would be given title to his property\nand that the amount of land that would revert to the Crown\nwas small.\nBrother XII was satisfied with the decision. No assets were\nattached to the Society, and he was now free to return the\nHess Trust. There were nine bonds, each worth a thousand\ndollars, remaining in the twenty thousand dollar fund. Frank\nCunliffe returned them to Oliver Hess, explaining that the\nproceeds from the other securities had been used “to the very\nlast cent” for the work of the Foundation.\nBut the government was still concerned about Brother XII’s\nactivities and hoped to launch criminal proceedings against\nhim to expel him from Valdes and DeCourcy. On November\n24\n, Corporal W. A. MacBrayne of the B.C. Provincial Police\nlanded on Valdes to have a firsthand look at the commu-\nnity. His cover story was that he was searching for the Tee-Hee,\na launch that had gone missing with its owner two months\nearlier. MacBrayne counted the number of houses in the set-\ntlement and made a few discreet inquiries of the disciples\nabout their activities. “They were very non-committal and un-\ninformative,” he observed in his report.\nThe next day, MacBrayne visited the farm on DeCourcy\nIsland, where he talked to two workmen who were draining a\nswamp. They informed him that Wilson lived in the lagoon on\nthe east side of the island. Steering his vessel through the reef,\nMacBrayne tied up at the float below Brother XII’s house. “I\nhad a chat with Mr. Wilson, but did not see the woman he\nis supposed to be living with,” MacBrayne wrote. Again, he\ngleaned very little information. He returned to Victoria, filing\na report of his investigation with the Superintendent of the\nB.C. Provincial Police.\nMacBrayne’s visit, coupled with a remark by Pooley to re-\nporters that the government intended to watch Brother XII’s\n\n260 B R O T H E R X I I\nactivities closely, made Wilson furious. He immediately wrote\nto Frank Cunliffe, protesting this harassment by the govern-\nment of a group of innocent settlers, who were minding their\nown business and interfering with no one:\nFor the government to “watch” such a little community\nis \npersecution. It really means that our enemies, having ob-\ntained the “ear of the government,” are trying to harm and\ndefame us, and if possible oust and dispossess us, using gov-\nernment officials as catspaws in the furtherance of their\nown spiteful plans.\nUnless the officials concerned recognize these facts and\nchange their attitude, we will take steps to bring the whole\nmatter to the attention of the Privy Council \nin Great Britain.\nOne of the chief instigators and prime movers in this attack\nis an alien German-American, a Prussian by birth. The writer\nis British born, a citizen of this Empire, and has a right to\njustice and a fair consideration of the facts of this case.\nIndeed, the government could find no legitimate reason to\nprosecute Brother XII. H. M. Garrett, Registrar of Companies,\nstudied MacBrayne’s report and advised the Attorney-\nGeneral that, beyond cancelling the charter of the Aquarian\nFoundation, it wasn’t possible for the government to take any\nfurther action. Based on the evidence he had, Garrett con-\ncluded: “Brother Wilson appears to be leading a quiet if not a\nproper life.”\nBrother XII now surprised everyone by abruptly leaving for\nEngland. Madame Z accompanied him. In Nanaimo, he met\nwith Frank Cunliffe and made the necessary legal arrange-\nments, drawing up a will and giving Alfred Barley power of\nattorney. He also put Barley in charge of the colony in his\nabsence.\nOn December 3, two days before he left British Columbia,\nhe issued a General Letter to the membership, announcing\nhis departure. He explained that he had been called away\n\nCity of Refuge 261\nfrom the Center “on matters that are vital to the safety and\npreservation of this whole Work, and I may be away for some\nmonths.” He instructed the members to make all cheques\npayable to Alfred Barley, since he himself would be unable to\nendorse such items in his absence. He promised to continue\nthe monthly letters, although they might arrive irregularly,\nsince he’d be posting them only as convenience allowed\nduring his travels. Assuring the members that all phases of the\nWork were going forward as planned, he closed his letter by\nexhorting them:\nWe are passing through the final stages of that long fight\nagainst those who have sought to destroy this Work. Stand\nfirm and loyal; continue to support our Cause as you have\ndone in the past—now, if ever, our need is great: it is the\nmoment of intensest struggle before the final Victory. Again\nI say, STAND FIRM—I go to establish that which shall prove\na sure refuge for you all.\nYour Brother in service,\nXII\n\nBruce McKelvie’s feature article about Brother XII, written for the\nNorth American Newspaper Alliance, appeared in newspapers across the\ncontinent, including Toronto’s \nEvening Telegram, May 20, 1933.\nThis drawing by\nartist Joan M.\nSmith illustrated\nan article about\nBrother XII in\nVictoria’s \nDaily\nColonist \non\nSeptember 30,\n1962.

(\nThe Vancouver Sun)\n\n262\nCHAPTER\nX\nA Test of Obedience\nA\ns midnight approached, thousands of excited revellers\nwearing paper hats and carrying noise-makers\ncrowded into St. Paul’s churchyard. In London’s\nWest End, the nightclubs were jammed with dancing couples.\nClaridge’s had been transformed into a Persian Garden and\nat the Berkeley, a midnight tableau featured Father Time and\nMiss 1930. As the final seconds of the 1920s ticked away, the\ncountdown began all across the great metropolis. As Big Ben\nbegan booming the midnight hour, the horns and sirens of\nthe boats on the Thames mingled with the cheers and hurrahs\nof the exultant crowds singing “Auld Lang Syne.” At the Savoy\nHotel, members of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company, dressed\nas Yeomen of the Guard, led over two thousand guests in song.\nAll across London church bells peeled, ringing in the New\nYear.\nBrother XII and Madame Z also celebrated the beginning\nof the 1930s in London. Although the “Messenger of the\n\nA Test of Obedience 263\nMasters” did not return triumphant from his crusade to bring\nthe Work of the Great White Lodge to America, Brother XII at\nleast took pride in still having a group of loyal followers here\nin the land of his birth. He apparently did not try to recruit\nnew members and there is no record of his having visited the\nPrivy Council as he had threatened. He’d written earlier, “The\nfirst great battle in this campaign has been fought \nand won,\nbut physically I am worn to the limit and very weary of it all.”\nEngland provided him with an opportunity to rest after the\nrigours of the past three years and to simply be himself.\nWhile in London, Brother XII published with L.N. Fowler\nand Company the monthly letters he’d written the previous\nyear. In the foreword to \nUnsigned Letters from an Elder Brother,\nhe stated: “The writer is not interested in fame or in a per-\nsonal ‘following’—the former is emptiness, the latter mostly\nunreliable. He will not countenance any organization, nor\nany attempt to create a cult amongst those who, as the result\nof reading these Letters, may wish to step out of the rut of\nmen and their affairs. But if any shall come to us in a spirit\nof teachableness, with a pure desire of Truth for Truth’s sake,\nand the will to unselfish service in the cause of humanity—we\nwill receive them.”\nThe book was judged favourably in \nThe Occult Review, al-\nthough the reviewer noted that the announcement in it that\na Center in British Columbia had been formed with strict re-\nquirements for admittance seemed curiously inconsistent with\nthe sentiments expressed by Brother XII in the foreword. Still,\nthe reviewer conceded, there was much material for thought\nand speculation in the pages of this “puzzling yet withal in-\ntriguing book.”\nBrother XII also published with L.N. Fowler \nA Primer of\nAstrology for Children. \nThe book was written by Annie Barley at\nWilson’s suggestion and was, he claimed, the first book on as-\ntrology written especially for children. In his foreword, he said\nthat the knowledge of astrology would have great importance\nin the coming age: “Let parents commence this study with the\n\n264 B R O T H E R X I I\nchild, and it will often be found that in these things, the child\nwill teach the parent. Has it not been written that ‘a little child\nshall lead them’!”\nIn London, Brother XII also wrote a General Letter to the\ndisciples in which he reviewed the stages of the Work. Perhaps\nfor the benefit of the doubters or the faint of heart, he told\nmembers that powerful forces were protecting their cause. He\nsaid that both the Center and his own residence during the\nmonths of October and November just past had been \n“guarded\nby hundreds of unseen horsemen; unseen by the physical eyes\nonly, but visible to such as have the inner sight, and plainly\nseen by some of our own number. When we left to carry on\nour Work and this Plan elsewhere, the horsemen disappeared\nand were seen no more.”\nAt the same time, he used the General Letter to answer crit-\nicism that his trip to England was simply to satisfy personal\nwhims. He referred members to their Bibles and the story of\nthe flight of Joseph and Mary into Egypt: “Read these records,\nand remember that history repeats itself, sometimes almost mi-\nnutely. Also, had some of our nominal members lived in that\nday, I fancy they would have whispered amongst themselves—\n‘What, going to Egypt! How impossible, how inconsistent after\nall these prophesyings by our old friends Hannah and Simeon\nand others. Evidently things have gone wrong and they have\ngone off the track—we never thought they would go to Egypt;\njust an excuse for a holiday, no doubt!’”\nDespite his disclaimer, Brother XII and Madame Z spent\ntime in one of the loveliest resorts in England, the ancient\nfishing village and boatbuilding center of Brixham on the\nDevonshire coast. Brixham was famous as the place where\nWilliam of Orange had landed in 1688 with fifteen thousand\ntroops, deposing King James II, England’s last Roman Catholic\nmonarch, in what is commonly known as the “Glorious\nRevolution.” A hundred years earlier in 1588, Sir Francis\nDrake, in his flagship \nRevenge, had towed the first warship cap-\ntured during the defeat of the Spanish Armada into Brixham’s\n\nA Test of Obedience 265\nharbour. And in 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte had been held\nprisoner here on board the Bellerophon, before being trans-\nferred to the \nNorthumberland, the ship that would take him to\nexile on Saint Helena—an exchange eagerly watched through\ntelescopes by an excited populace anxious for a glimpse of the\nlegendary French conqueror.\nBrother XII and Madame Z stayed at 37 King Street in a\nthree-storey terrace house overlooking the harbour. They\nvisited the boat yards of Jackman’s and Upham’s, renowned\nfor their Brixham trawlers. The oak beams used in their con-\nstruction were buried for years deep in the sand below Torbay\nBeach, a traditional pickling process that made the wood prac-\ntically indestructible. Brother XII had come to Brixham to buy\na sailboat. He chose a sturdy, seaworthy sixty-two foot Brixham\ntrawler with a gleaming black hull. It had been built in 1919\nfor three demobilized servicemen who’d named her \nUs Dree\n(Devonshire dialect for “We Three”). After their fishing ven-\nture failed to pay, she had passed into the hands of a wealthy\nEnglishwoman who’d converted her into a yacht, adding\nhandsome furnishings below deck. Wilson rechristened his\nvessel \nLady Royal and registered her with the Royal Corinthian\nYacht Club at Plymouth.\nBrother XII and Madame Z decided to sail the Lady Royal\nback to British Columbia. After testing their vessel off the\ncoast, they filled the water tanks, stocked the hold with provi-\nsions, and hired a local sailor named Merle Scott to accompany\nthem. In March, they sailed the Lady Royal out of Brixham’s\nharbour and into the English Channel, beginning a voyage\nthat would take them halfway around the world without the\nassistance of auxiliary power.\nr r r\nDuring Brother XII’s absence, the disciples continued to\nwork towards their goal of making the colony self-sufficient.\nRoger Painter returned with his new bride Leona and the two\n\n266 B R O T H E R X I I\nbecame the custodians of DeCourcy Island, living in Brother\nXII’s house at the Point. Harold Krause arrived with his mother-\nin-law, Anna Wilkerson, from Everett, Washington (Krause’s\nwife had died in childbirth). Sarah Puckett, a spirited seventy-\nsix-year-old retired schoolteacher from San Francisco, joined\nthe group, turning in her government pension to the Work.\nBill and Mary Lowell, who had been working as cooks in a\nmining camp in Nevada, arrived with three thousand dollars\nin cash. A powerfully-built man, Lowell was a former heavy-\nweight boxer and sparring partner of Jack Dempsey.\nAlfred Barley kept Brother XII informed of the progress\nthe disciples were making at the settlement. The letters he re-\nceived from him were generally of a practical nature, dealing\nwith various business matters relating to the colony. A tele-\ngram sent from Brixham on March 1, 1930 reads: “Have block\neighteen registered my name. Lowells belong Valdes.”\nOne night before he left for England, Brother XII appeared\nat Barley’s house, carrying a small, heavy bundle wrapped in\na towel. He didn’t tell Barley what was in it, but told him to\ntake good care of it as he was afraid of fire. Barley had put the\nbundle away unopened. He now received a letter advising him\nthat the bundle contained gold coins. Brother XII instructed\nhim to put the coins into a quart mason jar and fill the jar with\nmelted paraffin wax. He was then to have a wooden box made\nto hold the jar, and to sink the box in the cistern of Wilson’s\nhouse at Cedar. With his characteristic thoroughness, Barley\nfollowed these instructions exactly.\nBarley’s mother had died the previous December, and he\ninformed Brother XII that he expected to receive an inheri-\ntance of ten thousand dollars. He received a letter from Wilson\nin which, according to Annie Barley, he said, “Don’t you think\na nice thing to do with that money would be to put it into\nGreystone that we are about to build, and you yourself would\nhave your apartments there and live with me in that building,\nand it would be a palatial mansion.” When the money arrived\nin the summer of 1930, Barley banked it, holding it intact for\n\nA Test of Obedience 267\nBrother XII’s return.\nMary Connally was probably more surprised than anyone\nto learn that Brother XII had gone to England. She was in\nAsheville, North Carolina, preparing to come to British\nColumbia, when she received a note from him advising her\nof his trip. Mary finished packing and locked up Fernihurst,\nleaving the fifty-room mansion standing empty. She took the\ntrain to Seattle, where she remained awaiting news of Brother\nXII’s return.\nWhile in Seattle, Mary got a letter from Annie Barley, telling\nher that for “diplomatic reasons,” Brother XII would like her\nto buy his house at Cedar. Annie explained that this would\nsave him “annoyance and possible embarrassment in the\nfuture.” Mary was surprised by the request—she had planned\nto build on DeCourcy, not buy at Cedar. She didn’t know that\nthe “diplomatic reasons” were that Brother XII had promised\nthe house to Elma Wilson, but hadn’t made a deed of it to her,\nand that he wanted to get the house into Mary’s hands, so that\nElma couldn’t get it. Mary bought the house for four thousand\ndollars—although she later claimed it was only worth fifteen-\nhundred dollars—and in August 1930, she moved to Cedar.\nr r r\nAfter leaving Brixham, the Lady Royal crossed the Bay of\nBiscay in late March, heading for the Canary Islands. Brother\nXII reached Las Palmas in April, where he replenished his\nfood and water before launching out into the grey swells of\nthe Atlantic. Setting a course southwest, the \nLady Royal fol-\nlowed the classic route first travelled by Columbus, who made\nthe crossing in twenty-one days. For weeks, the sturdy little\ncraft was only a speck upon the vast ocean, yet with the trade\nwinds filling her sails, she made steady headway, until the crew\ncould at last make out the islands of the West Indies shining\non the horizon.\nBrother XII spent two months sailing the turquoise waters\n\n268 B R O T H E R X I I\nof the Caribbean, with its white beaches and cloudless skies.\nIn Kingston, Jamaica, he took the Lady Royal into the dry dock\nfor repairs. But after a quarrel with the owner, he refused to\npay his bill and demanded that his vessel be put back into the\nwater. He sailed away, not realizing that the incident would\nhave serious consequences.\nOn the Isle of Pines, Brother XII recruited another crew\nmember, an Englishman named Edric Douglas Agate. Edu-\ncated at Lancing College, a private boys’ school in Sussex, the\nhandsome and bearded twenty-five-year-old bore a striking re-\nsemblance to King George V despite the difference in age,\nand was often greeted by friends in crowded bars with cries\nof “Here comes the King!” Agate had worked in a bank in\nBangkok and had travelled widely. He was an interesting con-\nversationalist, and Mabel took an immediate fancy to him.\n“He’s just like his name,” she remarked to Wilson. “He’s like\nan agate!”\nThe \nLady Royal sailed to Panama, where Brother XII hired\ntwo San Blas Indians, named Louis John and Charles Foster,\nin the Canal port of Colon. With their white cotton trousers,\nstraw hats and bare feet, the two muscular and dark-skinned\nnatives added a picturesque look to the crew. After transiting\nthe Panama Canal, the \nLady Royal left Balboa on July 27,\n1930, to begin the long voyage up the Pacific coast to British\nColumbia.\nr r r\nAt the Brothers’ Center on Valdes Island, meanwhile, a\nsituation had developed that threatened the harmony of the\ncommunity. It centered around Oliver and Adelaide Heflinger,\nan older married couple from Los Angeles, and their adopted\ndaughter, a young woman from Haileybury, Ontario, named\nRegina LaCarte. Before he left, Brother XII had installed the\nthree in a cabin on Valdes and instructed them to remain\nthere during his absence. But for reasons that aren’t clear,\n\nA Test of Obedience 269\nAlfred Barley made repeated attempts to separate “Reggie”\nfrom the Heflingers. He finally ordered her to move to an-\nother cabin on Valdes and live with Sarah Puckett.\nAlthough Barley claimed to be carrying out Brother XII’s\ninstructions, Reggie refused to leave the Heflingers. Barley\naccused the three of forming a clique of their own and of per-\nsisting in an attitude of “non-cooperation.” In defence of their\nposition, Oliver quoted from \nFoundation Letters and Teachings:\n“Whenever one is asked to promise unquestioning obedience,\neither to a person or to a fraternity, something is wrong. No\ntrue Occultist, no Brother of the Right-hand path would make\nsuch a demand.”\nThe deadlock continued. Barley eventually wrote a curious\nletter to Reggie which lifts to some extent the veil of mystery\nsurrounding the disciples’ beliefs and provides an insight into\nthe peculiar psychology that motivated them. Barley’s anti-\nCatholic bias is evident in his disparaging allusions to the\n“so-called religion” of Regina’s childhood.\nPRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL\nThis story is written by one who wrote you formerly in the\nhope that you would stand the TEST OF OBEDIENCE, and\nwould not be misled and hypnotized by others.\nThere was a little girl who was born into a family with\na kindly mother, but with a very brutal father. This little\ngirl had to work to help support the family, but during the\ncourse of her work, she became interested in the higher\nteachings and aspired for chelaship. Her motives and her\naspirations were good, and The Masters decided that it was\npossible she could take that IMPORTANT STEP, and they\ncalled her to their Center.\nThe first condition that confronted her was rather diffi-\ncult—very little physical comfort or ease, and this she stood\nwell. After testing on this, she was prepared to take the next\nstep forward to ascertain if the servant (the brain mind)\ncould open that gate which leads to STRENGTH—discrimi-\n\n270 B R O T H E R X I I\nnation—and to test her on opening that door, she was placed\nwith a member of her own sex who had been reared in the\nsame so-called religion as her own. Herein is the wisdom of\nTHE MASTERS—more wise by far than the intellectualists\nor mentalists. They have their own way of testing, and the\nmentalists are unable to discriminate for the reason that one\nis third dimensional, while those who are able to hear the\nsilent voice intelligently are in Fourth Dimensional. So the\ntempter drew nigh and began to whisper—everything was\nmade smooth for her: ease, comfort, plenty to eat, with very\nlittle labour. To her mentality and lower self, things were\nindeed made very pleasant, as much love (so-called and\nmisnamed) and suave kindness were bestowed upon her,\nwhich indeed was pleasing to the consciousness of the body\nand its senses. She became lulled, failed to exercise the first\nQUALIFICATION—DISCRIMINATION—became blind as\nto what was her lower nature or her higher nature.\nAn order came, conveying to her in exact words, from\nthe representative of the XIIth House on the plane of form\n(physical plane). But the little girl had become so stupe-\nfied by suggestions that were more or less hypnotic that\nshe FAILED TO OBEY or even acknowledge receipt of the\nletter. The quality of the disciple is tested by the degree of\nhis obedience. The Masters then forwarded another com-\nmand, and this like the first was not heeded, nor the letter\nacknowledged. But The Masters had heard the call of the\nheart of that little girl, and decided in their wisdom to give\nher another opportunity to see if she could be freed from\nher mental enslavement. They sent another of their chelas,\nwho is OBEDIENT to their thought and who seeks only to\nserve the HIGHER, and this one being of a great heart and\nkind nature, was selected to make a final effort to free the\nlittle girl from her bondage. When an appeal was made for\nher to visit for a while, the soul cried out in tears for its re-\nlease, but again the mental enslavement WON.\nA little knowledge is dangerous, and for this reason,\n\nA Test of Obedience 271\nknowledge is withheld from those who are not able to stand\nit. The little girl was not taught by her so-called religion that\nthe priests have the knowledge as to how to create a tre-\nmendous thought-form, and further, that the fanatical of\nthe cult who have passed over become the servants of that\nthought-form, in order that the adherents may be held to\ntheir service. Therefore, in the talking to and fro between\nthe two of this cult, there was formed an entrance for one\nof those to whisper into the brain mind, instructing and\nadvising them so subtly that it seemed as though they were\nreceiving direction from their higher selves. But remember,\nthe senses had first been lulled and suggested to.\nHowever, The Masters in their great spirit of helpfulness\nto all those seeking Their WAY determined to make addi-\ntional endeavour to break this insidious bondage which, if\npersisted in, ends in total darkness and disintegration of the\nsoul, until its atomic parts are so scattered that it takes aeons\nand aeons of time for it to rebuild its constituent parts. So\nanother order came, and again was a messenger sent—the\none of the heart, who seeks not to serve self, but the brain\nmind of the little girl had been so instructed by that spirit\nwhich opposes humanity and The Great White Brothers\nthat the servant was again disobedient.\nThis is from one who has travelled a long long path, and\nwho did earnestly seek to free the soul of the little girl from\nthe mental domination, for the cry of the heart in its first\ncall to be carried to the heights had been heard. But it had\npermitted itself to become stupefied and dulled by the\nthought-form invoked, and hence it is not well to talk too\nmuch unless intelligence and discrimination are used.\nIf one looks to the personality of The Brother XII in the\nobjective world, they will never know what constitutes The\nBrother. They MUST look beyond the personality. I who\nam writing this to you, am still interceding that the door be\nheld open for you. Will you, or will you not, shake free, and\nbe YOURSELF. Failure is indeed a sad affair. FACE yourself\n\n272 B R O T H E R X I I\nand know YOURSELF.\nI trust this little story is not too long, and that you will\nabsolutely consider it private and confidential, not to be\nshown to anyone. The betrayer has always been Judas, and\none that betrays another brother can know the spirit of\nJudas possessed him. A hint should be sufficient.\nr r r\nAfter leaving Panama, the Lady Royal was hit by a storm\nwhile coming up the Mexican coast. For days, the little sail-\nboat was pounded relentlessly by huge waves. When the storm\nfinally abated, she had been driven far off course and was in\nequatorial waters hundreds of miles from land. There was no\nwind and she lay becalmed for weeks. The storm had dam-\naged the provisions: there was kerosene in the drinking water\nand worms in the oatmeal, which the crew ate—worms and\nall. Eventually, the rations ran out and the crew became too\nweak to even sail the vessel.\nOn October 5, 1930, seventy-one days out of Balboa, the\nLady Royal was drifting helplessly six hundred miles southwest\nof San Francisco. It was 8:00 P.M. and the seas were heavy.\nSeveral of the crew were lying on deck close to death. Wilson\nwas considering sacrificing his pet water spaniel for food,\nwhen she started to bark furiously—she’d sighted a ship! One\nof the crew managed to light an improvised flare.\nOn board the Matson liner S.S. \nWilhelmina, bound from\nHonolulu to San Francisco, Third Mate W.P. Peters noticed\na flickering light to starboard. The big passenger ship hauled\noff course and went to investigate. There in the beam of the\nliner’s powerful searchlight lay the Lady Royal. According to\nThe San Francisco News, which carried a report of the rescue,\nCaptain E.R. Johanson ordered a boat lowered to go to the as-\nsistance of the stricken vessel. As his rescuers came on board,\nWilson gasped, \n“We’re thankful you got here!”\nThe boat made three trips to the Lady Royal, stocking her\n\nA Test of Obedience 273\nhold with fresh fruit and vegetables, two sides of beef, a crate\nof eggs and other provisions. Wilson sent money to pay for\nthe stores, but Captain Johanson returned it. The lights of the\nWilhelmina disappeared into the night, leaving the crew of the\nLady Royal to thank Providence for their miraculous escape.\nIn British Columbia, the news of the amazing rescue ap-\npeared in \nThe Victoria Colonist, headlined, “MATSON LINER\nAIDS YACHT BOUND HERE,” alerting the government to\nBrother XII’s return to the province. Attorney-General Pooley\nsent a clipping to Colonel J. H. McMullin, Superintendent of\nthe B.C. Provincial Police, asking: “Is this not Bro 12?”\nMcMullin contacted Assistant Inspector George E. Norris of\nthe Customs and Excise Preventive Service and asked him to\nhave the customs officer at William Head Quarantine Station,\nsouth of Victoria, ask all incoming vessels if they had seen\nthe \nLady Royal. McMullin suspected Brother XII might try to\nsmuggle members of his sect into the province.\nSergeant Jack Russell of the Nanaimo detachment of the\nB.C. Provincial Police made a special trip to Cedar-by-the-\nSea, where he interviewed Maurice Von Platen, who informed\nhim that there were about five or six persons on board the\nLady Royal. But neither Von Platen nor anyone else at Cedar\nseemed to know when Brother XII was due to arrive in British\nColumbia.\nIn his report, Russell commented: “From my own knowl-\nedge of E.A. Wilson, who is a very shrewd man, I am of the\nopinion that he will not try to evade any Customs or Immi-\ngration regulations.”\nOn Wednesday, November 5, 1930, a thick blanket of fog\ncovered the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The ghostly silhouette of\na two-masted sailing ship emerged from the mist and slipped\nunseen past the Customs Station at William Head. Vanishing\ninto the eerie whiteness shrouding Haro Strait, the vessel\nmoved steadily northwards towards DeCourcy Island.\nBrother XII now encountered his most serious difficulty\n\n274 B R O T H E R X I I\nnavigating. The wind died and the current threatened to drive\nhis vessel onto the rocks. Luckily, the fog lifted and two United\nStates Coast Guard preventive boats spotted the \nLady Royal in\ndistress and guided her into the safety of Roche Harbour on\nSan Juan Island.\nBrother XII and Madame Z left the \nLady Royal in Roche\nHarbour and took a launch directly to DeCourcy Island.\nReturning the next morning in the \nKhuenaten, they towed the\nLady Royal through the Gulf Islands to DeCourcy.\nMary Lowell was one of the disciples at the Point when\nBrother XII towed the \nLady Royal into the lagoon. She went\ndown to the water to help him unload the sailboat, but he\nswore at her and told her to get away from the boat.\n“He had a bunch of parcels on board,” she said. “He carried\nthem off and he wouldn’t allow anyone to touch them. He hid\nthem in different parts of the island—parcels of different sizes\nwrapped in black oilcloth. . . I stood on the shore and watched\nhim hiding them in different places, and all the time he was\nswearing and raving.”\nWhile Brother XII was hiding the parcels, Madame Z and\nAgate stood on the beach, watching for government boats. Z\npaced up and down in a tremendous state of agitation, afraid\nthat an Immigration vessel would come into the lagoon and\nseize the \nLady Royal before it was unloaded.\n“He had just finished hiding these things in three or four\ndifferent places in the bush,” Mary recalled, “when a boat did\ncome in and sailed around. We had a bale of green tomatoes\non a scow in the bay, and a man got out and looked at these to-\nmatoes, and [Brother XII and Z] were in a terrible state, and\nthen the boat sailed on out of the harbour. And he came up\nto her and said, ‘Well, I will have a cup of tea,’ and then they\nsent me home.”\nWhat was in the parcels? Later reports that Brother XII\nwould load a launch and make nocturnal trips to the main\nshore of Vancouver Island when the blinking headlights of an\nautomobile signalled DeCourcy Island, there to rendezvous\n\nA Test of Obedience 275\nwith the Oriental occupants of the car, has led to the surmise\nthat the parcels contained drugs. Brother XII’s increasingly\nirrational behaviour is also cited as evidence to support this\ntheory. It is known, however, that at least some of the parcels\ncontained copies of Unsigned Letters from an Elder Brother and\nA Primer of Astrology for Children, which he’d had published in\nEngland, and which he was no doubt afraid that the govern-\nment would confiscate.\nAfter the \nLady Royal was unloaded, Brother XII sent Alfred\nBarley to Nanaimo to notify Customs Officer H.L. Good that\nthe vessel was in the lagoon at DeCourcy awaiting inspection.\nWhen Barley returned with the message that the \nLady Royal\nwould have to be brought into Nanaimo at once, Brother XII\nflew into a rage and cursed Good. Nonetheless, the following\nmorning he took the Lady Royal into Nanaimo, and passed\nthe Customs inspection without incident.\nAfter making formal entry into Canada, Brother XII took\nthe \nLady Royal into the Nanaimo dry dock. As his vessel was\nwinched up the stays, he was astonished to see an enormous\nclotted mass of seaweed clinging to the bottom of his boat.\nWhen he hacked it away, he discovered an iron bar sticking\nout about ten feet on each side of the keel.\nThe owner of the dry dock in Kingston had devised a\nunique form of revenge. After his argument with Wilson and\nbefore he put the \nLady Royal back into the water, he’d drilled\na hole in the keel and hammered the bar through. Wilson had\nsailed through the Caribbean and up the Pacific coast, never\nsuspecting that the reason his vessel was so sluggish and un-\nresponsive in the storms that struck her was because she was\ndragging about five tons of kelp beneath her. By all accounts,\nhe was livid.\nBrother XII’s return to British Columbia attracted\nmajor publicity. Bruce McKelvie wrote a front page story\nin \nThe Victoria Colonist, headlined: “SMALL CRAFT ENDS\nHAZARDOUS OCEAN TRIP AT NANAIMO.” He described\nWilson as an experienced navigator and lover of the sea, and\n\n276 B R O T H E R X I I\nobserved that his adventurous voyage smacked of “the fanciful\nundertakings of a Henty thriller or a Clark Russell story.”\nMaurice Von Platen objected to the publicity given Brother\nXII’s return. He sent a copy of McKelvie’s article to the\nAttorney-General, saying he believed Wilson intended to\nuse such stories as a means of recruiting followers. He asked\nPooley to issue a statement making it clear that the Aquarian\nFoundation had been dissolved in the public interest and that\nWilson was prohibited by law from making any further use of\nthe name.\nPooley, who had already received a great number of inquiries\nabout Brother XII’s return, called a press conference. He an-\nnounced that the government wouldn’t tolerate any attempt\nby Brother XII to revive the Aquarian Foundation, and told\nreporters that as far as the Attorney-General’s office was con-\ncerned, “the operations of the Aquarian Foundation are at an\nend.”\nr r r\nThe disciples at the Brothers’ Center were glad that Brother\nXII was back, although for the first week or so they saw very\nlittle of him. He secluded himself on DeCourcy Island and\ndidn’t speak to anyone.\n“He went immediately to DeCourcy with the greatest\nsecrecy,” Mary Connally recalled. “The thing I couldn’t under-\nstand was all the secrecy. The blinds were pulled down and the\nlights were darkened, and I didn’t know anything more that\nwas going on there than if I had been an entire stranger.”\nOn Sunday morning, November 16, Madame Z walked un-\nannounced into Mary’s house at Cedar. The two women had a\nlong talk, during which Z told Mary that Brother XII expected\nher on DeCourcy Island soon. She also invited Mary to attend\na general meeting that was being held that morning in the\nCenter Building at Cedar.\nAt the meeting, Brother XII read an eighteen-page letter\n\nA Test of Obedience 277\nthat set out his new plans for the colony. One of the changes\nhe proposed was the formation of an advisory council, to be\ncomposed of Alfred Barley, Roger Painter, Bruce Crawford,\nBill Lowell, and Sarah Puckett, with himself as chairman. It\nwould allow the disciples to participate in decisions affecting\nthe colony and would give them greater autonomy.\nBrother XII spent about twenty minutes after the meeting\ntalking to Mary Connally. It was the last real conversation she\nwas to have with him: “Apart from seeing him about half a\ndozen times, for perhaps five minutes at a time, I never saw\nhim or talked to him or had any conversation with him. As far\nas the personnel were concerned, he absolutely ignored me as\ncompletely as if I didn’t exist.”\nRoger Painter was another disciple baffled by Brother XII’s\nbehaviour. As a member of the new advisory council, he at-\ntended a meeting at which a drag-saw was ordered. When the\nsaw arrived, he took it to the Point and was busy sawing wood\nfor the stoves when Brother XII approached him:\n“He came up and said, ‘Why, this is a fine saw.’\n“Then, speaking louder, he said, ‘ This is a fine saw!’\n“And I said, ‘Yes, we will cut some wood.’\n“He said, ‘Isn’t this the one that has been rehabilitated and\nmade over?’\n“And I said, ‘No, Brother; this is a new saw that we bought.’\n“And like a flash, he came at me and cursed me for every-\nthing under the sun, and called me a dirty low-down sneak,\nand said that I had undermined him.\n“I had forgotten that he had authorized the saw at the ad-\nvisory council meeting. And I said, ‘All right, sir; you can call\nme what you please, but I am not a sneak!’\n“And he talked with me there for three solid hours, and\ncalled me every name under the sun, and at last Bruce Crawford\nhappened to remember the case, that he had authorized the\ndrag-saw himself—and that one time, we got the best of him!”\nNot long after this incident, Brother XII dispensed with the\nadvisory council, giving as his reason that it had taken action\n\n278 B R O T H E R X I I\nwithout referring the matter to himself. “In short,” as Alfred\nBarley put it, “it had constituted itself an administrative instead\nof an \nadvisory body.”\nOn Valdes Island, the Heflingers and Regina LaCarte re-\nmained isolated in their cabin, unaware that Brother XII had\nreturned. Alfred Barley sent them a letter demanding that they\nquit the premises, but the letter was so ambiguously worded\nthat they didn’t know if it was from Brother XII or not, so they\nignored it.\nAt about ten o’clock on the morning of December 19, 1930,\nOliver Heflinger heard his dog barking and looked out the\nwindow of the cabin. He saw Bruce and Georgia Crawford, Bill\nand Mary Lowell, Harold Krause, and the two Panamanian\nIndians, Louis John and Charles Foster, filing down the trail.\nWhen he opened the door, Crawford handed him three\nletters.\n“Do you want them or don’t you?” he asked.\nHeflinger hesitated, uncertain what to say, but Adelaide\nstepped up behind him and cried, “We don’t want any more\nof your letters! We’ve had enough of them!”\nCrawford slowly put the letters in his pocket, then said,\n“Come on boys!” He and Bill Lowell grabbed Heflinger and\npulled him out into the yard, where Harold Krause and the\ntwo Indians tied him up.\n“Is this what you call Brotherhood?” Oliver protested.\n“Keep still or I’ll smash you in the face!” Lowell said.\n“Would you hit a man with his hands tied behind his back?”\n“If you don’t keep still, I’ll show you what I’ll do!”\nCrawford and the others marched into the house and\ngrabbed the two women. Adelaide and Reggie tried to resist,\nbut Crawford and Krause forced their arms down by their\nsides, while John and Foster tied them with rope around the\nelbows, then pushed them out the door and into the yard.\n“You have been after this girl in a dirty way for a year,”\nAdelaide said as Crawford tied Reggie’s wrists behind her\nback.\n\nA Test of Obedience 279\n“Yes, I have,” Crawford replied, “and what are you going to\ndo about it?”\nThe others went back inside the house and began throwing\nthe Heflingers’ bedding and other things into the yard,\nignoring their pleas to be careful. When Oliver and the two\nwomen agreed to cooperate, Crawford untied them. The\nthree were led single-file down the trail to the landing and\nwere rowed out to the \nKhuenaten, which was anchored in\nthe bay. After their belongings were loaded on board, they\nwere held on the tugboat for three hours before it started for\nVancouver Island.\nThe three were dropped off at Boat Harbour, south of\nCedar, where Alfred Barley was waiting with Heflinger’s car.\n“There is your machine,” he said to Oliver. “You can get in and\nfollow me for the road out.” It was now dark and Heflinger\nlost sight of Barley’s tail-lights on the twisting road. He came\nout on the main highway and drove to the Cranberry Hotel,\nwhere the three spent the night.\nIn Nanaimo, the Heflingers were interviewed by Sergeant\nRussell, Staff-Sergeant Owens, and Inspector W. S. Parsons of\nthe B.C. Provincial Police. The three officers concluded that\nalthough there was sufficient evidence to warrant prosecu-\ntion for kidnapping and assault, there could be little hope\nof securing a conviction. Parsons examined some of the\nAquarian Foundation literature in the Heflingers’ possession.\nIn his report to Superintendent J.H. McMullin, he observed:\n“It disclosed borrowings from the precepts of Buddhism,\nBrahminism, Occultism, Astrology, Theosophy, and the rituals\nof Egypt. I noticed, too, that what is described as sexual rela-\ntionship amongst ordinary people is touched upon within the\nsect as spiritual affinity. Probably, if the full truth is known, the\nleaders would be found to have more or less free intercourse\nwith the more engaging of their female followers.”\nThe Heflingers had the balance of the money they’d\ncontributed to Brother XII’s common maintenance fund re-\nturned to them by Frank Cunliffe. They received back $1,320;\n\n280 B R O T H E R X I I\nRegina LaCarte had forty-two dollars refunded and was given\na train ticket to Toronto, which she never used. She and the\nHeflingers remained in Nanaimo, living together in a tiny\napartment on the outskirts of town. Oliver’s sister, Lydia\nHoward, visited them there in the summer of 1932.\n“They were living in near-poverty,” she recalls. “My brother\nwas very disappointed in this group and was reluctant to say\nmuch about it. He was reading a book called A Dweller on Two\nPlanets when I was there and he would refer to that a great\ndeal when we were talking.\n“Reggie was the delicate, reclusive type. All she could talk\nabout was Mahatma Gandhi—she worshipped the very idea\nof his name. Her hero worship was so extreme, it seemed to\nborder on mental illness. And she’d say things like, ‘This capi-\ntalist system is all wrong!’”\nWhen World War II broke out, the Heflingers and Regina\nLaCarte returned to California. Adelaide died soon after from\ninfluenza. Reggie underwent a remarkable transformation:\nshe made herself beautiful, married a lawyer in Oakland, and\nhad a child. Oliver continued working as a house painter in\nLos Angeles, dying there in 1961 at the age of eighty-one.\n“My father always said Oliver was the dreamer of the family,”\nhis sister recalls. “But I know he was quite disillusioned with\nthis Aquarian community up in British Columbia. He had\nnothing good to say about it.”\nElma Wilson, meanwhile, had returned from Switzerland\nafter helping to organize a group there, only to discover that\nBrother XII wanted nothing more to do with her. He made\nit clear that she wasn’t welcome on Valdes or DeCourcy—or\neven at Cedar, since Mary Connally was now living in the house\nhe’d promised her. Still intimately involved with Madame Z,\nhe had no place for Elma in his life.\nElma didn’t completely give up hope. She took lodgings in\nNorth Vancouver, where she worked in the reference depart-\nment of the public library. She remained friends with the\n\nA Test of Obedience 281\nJeffersons, often going for walks on the weekend with Dora,\nto whom she confided that she was still deeply in love with\nWilson.\n“She didn’t say very much,” Herbert Jefferson recalls, “but I\nthink she must have been terribly let down. I know she wrote\na letter to him in which she said, ‘If ever you want any help,\nnever mind the past; all will be forgiven. I’m still fond of you,\nand whatever you’ve done to me in the way of letting me down,\nI’ll still take you back.’\n“I think she must have died shortly afterwards because\nwe never heard from her again. She went back to Scotland,\nI believe. She was a typical highbrow and bluestocking—the\nold-fashioned type. A nice person, but not the type that he\nwanted.”\nOn Sunday morning, December 21, 1930, the Barleys had\njust finished breakfast when they heard a loud knock on\nthe door. Opening it, they saw Bruce Crawford, Bill Lowell,\nHarold Krause, and the two Panamanians standing on the\nporch—a contingent which Wilson afterwards complacently\nreferred to as his “wrecking gang.” Crawford presented Barley\nwith a letter from Brother XII which advised him and Annie\nthat circumstances made it necessary that they be transferred\nimmediately to Valdes Island. According to Barley, the letter\nwas “a masterly production, being nicely calculated to remove\nany tendency on my part to display unwillingness or unreadi-\nness to go.”\nBarley had no sooner finished reading the letter than “the\ngang” was hard at work removing him and his wife, lock, stock\nand barrel, from their house and carrying all of their belong-\nings down to the \nKhuenaten.\nIn the house next door, Mary Connally was sitting at her\ntypewriter composing a letter when Bruce Crawford and Bill\nLowell walked in. Crawford handed the startled woman a note\nfrom Brother XII which said that owing to “adverse condi-\ntions” at Cedar, she must leave immediately for Valdes Island.\n\n282 B R O T H E R X I I\n“The note asked me to please give these people all the help\nI could, as they knew what to do,” Mary recounted.\nCrawford told Leona Painter, who was living with Mary at\nthe time, that she would accompany her to Valdes Island.\nWith that, the wrecking gang began packing up all of Mary’s\nbelongings and carrying them down to the tugboat.\nA short while later, bundled up against the cold, Mary and\nLeona stood on the deck of the \nKhuenaten with the Barleys\nand watched the houses of the Cedar settlement recede as the\ntug headed across Stuart Channel towards Valdes Island.\nWhen the \nKhuenaten reached Valdes, the wrecking gang\nunloaded the tugboat, then stood back. Crawford told the\nnew arrivals that they would have to carry everything by them-\nselves up to the two cabins they would occupy. The \nKhuenaten\nchugged away, leaving the little group standing in the midst of\na huge pile of tables, chairs, dressers and cabinets, clothing,\nbedding and linen, heavy steamer trunks, kitchen utensils, a\nsewing machine, boxes of books and other personal belong-\nings. The four began hauling everything across the landing to\nthe trail which led up to the cabins. Mary Connally and Leona\nPainter’s destination was a cabin located a quarter of a mile\naway at the top of a steep hill. The Barleys had been assigned\nto another cabin an eighth of a mile beyond that.\nThe little group struggled valiantly, dragging their things\nto the beginning of the trail before undertaking the difficult\ntask of lugging everything up to the cabins. The two elderly\nwomen and the frail Barley were unaccustomed to physical\nlabour of any kind—Annie and Mary were both sixty-three\nyears of age—but they worked strenuously, awkwardly car-\nrying their heavy burdens up the primitive trail. Stumbling\nover rocks and tree roots, hands numbed by the cold, limbs\naching from the strain, they tried desperately to finish before\ndarkness fell.\nAt last, they had successfully moved everything into the two\ncabins. They sank down, exhausted from the ordeal. In spite\nof their fatigue, however, they must have felt gratified by their\n\nA Test of Obedience 283\neffort, for they knew that the transfer to Valdes Island had a\nspecial significance.\n“It had been generally understood among us,” Barley later\nexplained, “that Cedar, Valdes and DeCourcy represented\nthree degrees of discipleship. Cedar was for the merely inter-\nested; Valdes was for the neophytes; and DeCourcy was for the\naccepted disciples. According to one’s fitness or adaptability,\nhe or she might be graded to, or maybe de-graded from, one\nor other of these locations as the general development of the\nWork might determine. When a sudden removal was insisted\nupon, it was supposed that the person so moved had in some\nway ‘fallen down on the job,’ or else was taking the place of\nsome other who had side-slipped, and the seemingly needless\ninconvenience was cheerfully accepted.”\nActing in this spirit, Barley sat down as soon as the move to\nValdes was completed and even before getting a meal wrote a\nletter to Brother XII. He later recalled: “I cooperated with all\nmy heart and wrote him on the same day, saying it was ‘the finest\ngame I had ever played,’ lest the kindly heart I then believed in\nshould imagine that I had been put to any discomfort.”\nIn their cabin on Valdes, Mary Connally and Leona Painter\nwere forced to make do as best they could in primitive living\nconditions. The house had been stripped when its former\noccupants, the Heflingers and Regina LaCarte, were evicted.\nIt was now little more than an empty shell, with a rough floor\nand holes in the walls. The cold came up through the floor-\nboards from the frozen ground below, since the house had no\nfoundation of any kind. Mary’s bedroom faced north and had\nhuge windows which let out all the heat from the one-hole\ncoal stove she’d brought with her. The only other source of\nheat was a small cooking stove in the main room. There was\nno plumbing or running water, just an outhouse and a well\nfor water.\nValdes Island was bleak in winter. A bitterly cold wind blew\nin from the Strait of Georgia, chilling Mary and Leona to\nthe bone. They spent most of their time wrapped in heavy\n\n284 B R O T H E R X I I\nsweaters and overcoats, huddling around the coal stove, trying\nto keep warm. At night, the cold penetrated every crack in\nthe house, making sleep impossible. This was not the kind of\nChristmas to which Mary was accustomed in Asheville. There\nwas no brightly-lit tree, crackling fire or turkey dinner, no\nfamily or friends with whom to celebrate the holiday season—\nonly the two of them, alone and miserable in a wretched hovel\non Valdes Island.\nMary found her present circumstances ironic, given the fact\nthat Nanaimo residents had thought the “Aquarium Founda-\ntion” had something to do with fish: “You can imagine the\ncold that I suffered,” she recalled. “That was an ‘Aquarium.’ I\nused to feel that I was in an aquarium of ice-cold water every\nnight.”\nThe Barleys were warmer and more comfortable in their\ncabin. They had only been on Valdes for about a week when\nBrother XII invited them over to DeCourcy Island to visit him\nand Madame Z. In the evenings, the two couples sat around\nthe fire and talked of their mutual interests.\nOne night, the Barleys were surprised to hear Madame Z\ncomplain bitterly about Mary Connally. “You know, Annie,”\nshe said, “with reference to this Work, we have some very dif-\nficult problems to solve. Mary Connally is our worst problem.\nShe is the fussiest person. She wants her servants. If she wanted\na glass of water, she wouldn’t get it for herself. She wants this,\nthat, and the other, and she expects us to wait on her. That is\nall very fine, but we cannot do it.”\nBrother XII, who was sitting nearby, nodded in agreement.\n“Yes,” he added, “she will never do for this Work. She even\nwants us to bring her a cup of coffee in the morning before\nshe can get up!”\nThe invitation to DeCourcy was to prompt more than a\nsocial call from the Barleys. Their visit conveniently provided\nAlfred with the opportunity to turn over his inheritance to\nBrother XII, as well as the remainder of his savings.\nOn December 31, 1930, the Barleys made a special trip into\n\nA Test of Obedience 285\nNanaimo. Alfred withdrew $4,900 from the Canadian Bank\nof Commerce, the second installment of his inheritance,\nadding it to the $5,100 that he’d withdrawn earlier. During\nBrother XII’s absence, he’d also put aside $1,855 in gold\ncoins and $760 in two-dollar bills, to make a grand total of\n$12,615. Barley was acting in accordance with Brother XII’s\ninstructions to the disciples that all contributions must be in\npermanently negotiable securities—the order of preference\nbeing gold, dominion currency bills, and bank bills of the\nsmallest denomination.\nThe Barleys spent the night in Nanaimo, staying at the\nGlobe Hotel. Alfred’s solemn mood was in marked contrast\nto the festivities of the small town welcoming the New Year. “I\nwell remember the noise of the fireworks,” he recalled.\nOn the evening of January 2, 1931, Brother XII rowed\nBarley out to the \nLady Royal, which was anchored in the\nlagoon. Once on board, he asked Bruce and Georgia Craw-\nford to withdraw because he and Alfred had “some business\nto transact.” Barley, who had wrapped the money in brown\npaper, put several packages on the table. Brother XII didn’t\nopen the packages and count the money, but asked Barley to\nwrite on each one the amount it contained and his initials. He\nthen locked the packages in the small safe in the cabin of the\nLady Royal. There were no witnesses to the transaction.\n“I noted the strange circumstances of our being alone on\nthe ship,” Barley recalled, “and reflected that it was ‘open to\nconstruction,’ as they say, had I been disposed to suspect him.\nBut when you take a man for a spiritual leader, you treat him\nas one, and therefore I regarded this circumstance as a test of\nmy single-mindedness, which indeed it might have been.”\nA few days later, Brother XII called Roger Painter on\nboard. He opened the safe, removed a package containing\nabout $4,000 in ten- and twenty-dollar bills, and handed it to\nPainter with the words, “Here, take this money, Roger, and get\nit changed into one- and two-dollar bills. I don’t see why that\nfool Barley didn’t give me ones and twos, instead of tens and\n\n286 B R O T H E R X I I\ntwenties!”\nThe Barleys returned to Valdes Island. They were amazed\nto find Mary Connally’s things in their cabin and to discover\nthat their own belongings had been transferred to the cabin\noccupied by Mary and Leona. In short, they’d been made to\ntrade places with them. Barley was mystified. “Here again,\nno reason ever transpired for this sudden and arbitrary \nvolte\nface,” he recalled. “No reason even now suggests itself to me,\nbeyond finding out just how far we could be played about\nwith, without rebelling.”\nA few days after Mary Connally and Leona Painter had in-\nstalled themselves in the cabin, Madame Z appeared and told\nMary that she would have to work like the other colonists.\nTaking Leona aside, she told her that she was not to wait on\nMary any more, that Mary had to learn how to do things for\nherself. “I do not even want you to wash a dish for her,” she in-\nstructed Leona.\nMary now began to work like she’d never worked before.\nShe cooked, scrubbed floors, washed windows, spaded the\ngarden, painted the floors in two unfinished cabins, chopped\nand carried wood, and helped the other disciples with their\nchores. She was also made “the carrier,” the person who had to\ntransport the food and other supplies to the different cabins\non the island. Bent over from the weight of the heavy loads\non her back, Mary staggered along the forest trails, supervised\nby Leona Painter, who drove her relentlessly, making sure she\nnever stopped to rest.\n“I thought possibly it was a test,” Mary said later. “I had been\nraised in great luxury and wasn’t supposed to lift a glass of\nwater for myself.”\nMary believed that the constant work and physical privation\nwas a form of initiation, which would strengthen her soul and\nprepare her to take a step forward into higher consciousness.\n“It was a species of discipline—discipline to the limit—and\nI was very proud, I suppose, and I didn’t want to think that\n\nA Test of Obedience 287\nanybody could do what I couldn’t do, and I did push myself\nto the limit.”\nOn January 30, 1931, after nearly a month of gruelling\nlabour, Mary received a letter from Brother XII:\nDear Lady Mary:\nAfter some consideration, it seems to me that the condi-\ntions on Valdes are too primitive for you, and although the\nchange from Cedar has, I hope, done you some good, yet I\ndo not think you would be either happy or wise to remain\nthere indefinitely.\nWill you let me know if you would prefer to return to\nCedar, because if so, we will arrange to make the transfer\nfor you at the earliest moment. My feeling is that you should\nreturn to Cedar and remain there (or at any other outside\npoint you may choose). . .\nMary knew what the letter meant—she had failed the test.\nShe was devastated: “It nearly broke my heart to think that I\nhad failed. Going back to Cedar was a disgrace—it was a dis-\ngrace. I was trying to make the grade, and I didn’t know what\nto do. I felt sick. I wished I were dead.”\nMary replied to the letter by writing to Brother XII, telling\nhim she was happy on Valdes and wished to remain there: “I\nwas trying to make the grade and I was so sick, I didn’t know\nwhat to do. I wanted to be dead and I pretended to be happy\nwhen I wasn’t.”\nMadame Z arrived at Mary’s cabin and told her to be ready\nto leave at a moment’s notice. Mary accepted the situation\nand packed her things: “There is no Czar in the world that\nhas been more autocratic. I even packed my underdress and\ntoothbrush for a week, so that if they came in the morning, I\nwould be ready.”\nThe days passed and no one came. Two weeks later, Madame\nZ appeared at the cabin and informed Mary that she would\nremain on Valdes Island.\n\n288 B R O T H E R X I I\nMary resolved to make the most of this second chance to\nprove herself. She redoubled her efforts, driving herself to\nthe point of exhaustion. Some of the jobs seemed pointless. “I\nhad to walk this trail every day to see if there was any mail,” she\nrecalled. “It was a three-mile walk. I walked that trail every day\nfor a period of three weeks—and there was never any mail.\nBut rain or shine, snow or heat, I had to go.”\nMary was again mercilessly supervised by Leona Painter, who\nmade sure the older woman carried out all her tasks at high\nspeed and under the most terrific pressure. Leona herself was\nbeing driven by fears which Brother XII had planted in her\nmind. Shortly after he’d returned from England, he’d sepa-\nrated Leona from her new husband and forbade the couple to\nsee each other. He’d told Leona that if she didn’t do exactly as\nshe was told, she would lose her soul: “When he told us that we\nhad failed in the Work, why, we were lost for aeons of time—\nand that would put you through intense agony—and they sent\nme away, and I didn’t know whether I would see my husband\nagain. And that—combined with the other pressure they put\non me—made it all I could do to keep hold of my mind.”\nMary didn’t realize at the time why Leona treated her so\ncruelly. It was only later that she learned of the young wom-\nan’s desperation: “She drove me as she certainly wouldn’t\nhave done if she hadn’t been on the verge of losing her mind.\nNobody would have driven a woman of my age—with the\nweakness of my body—the way she drove me. She was almost\ninsane from being separated from her husband, and from the\nfear of losing her soul.”\nThree weeks later, Roger Painter came to Valdes with orders\nfrom Brother XII that the two women must return to Cedar.\nOnce again, they had to be ready to leave at a moment’s\nnotice. After delivering his message, Painter returned at once\nto DeCourcy Island—obeying Brother XII’s directive not to\notherwise communicate with them.\nMary and Leona quickly packed their things and waited for\nthe \nKhuenaten. Several days passed. Then Madame Z appeared\n\nA Test of Obedience 289\nat the door and told them to move into a nearby warehouse\nand to remain there until further notice, since several new ar-\nrivals to the colony would be moving into their cabin. Mary and\nLeona carried their belongings over to a dilapidated wooden\nbuilding with a dirt floor. Boards were missing from the walls\nand there was a gaping hole in the roof through which the\nrain poured. Again, the only source of heat was the one-hole\ncoal stove that they brought with them, and their only source\nof water was at the top of the hill, two hundred yards away.\nMary and Leona tried to patch the hole in the roof and\nmend the broken walls. Wet and miserable, they huddled in\nthe dark interior of their squalid home, sleeping on straw mat-\ntresses and shivering from the cold. At the end of three days\nand nights, they were exhausted and demoralized.\nThe fourth morning, Madame Z suddenly appeared from\naround the corner of the warehouse. “You have to leave in\ntwenty minutes,” she told them. “The Brother is here. I just saw\nhim, just spoke to him. You cannot take any of your things—\nyou can buy others.”\nThe two women desperately began packing up some of\ntheir belongings to take back to Cedar. Mary started pulling\nher dresses out of the trunks she’d put them in, but Madame\nZ stopped her. She marched Mary and Leona down the trail\nto the \nKhuenaten, which carried them swiftly away from shore.\n“I had to leave everything,” Mary recalled. “All my dresses and\neverything I had were strewn out there and left in the pouring\nrain!”\nMary and Leona were returned to Cedar on March 17, 1931,\nafter spending three months on Valdes. But their ordeal was\nnot yet over. Madame Z commanded them to cultivate a three-\nacre field in order to “provide food for the destitute.” The two\nwomen worked seven hours a day, plowing and harrowing the\nfield. They even worked in the rain, wading through the mud\nlike two penitents, in the belief that it was a test to make them\nfit to serve humanity.\n\n290 B R O T H E R X I I\n“I still didn’t realize,” Mary said. “I thought it was a test just\nto see if I could make good, if there was anything in this world\nthat would hold me back in this work I had come here for—\nthe freeing of humanity from its shackles.”\nThe work took its toll upon the elderly woman. Mary’s\nbody ached, her hands became rough and worn, and she lost\ntwenty-eight pounds during the time she worked in the field.\nThe other disciples noticed how frail and ill she looked, but\nthey did not help her, since Madame Z had forbidden them to\ncommunicate with either Mary or Leona.\n“They instilled in all of us the most horrible religious su-\nperstition that could be imagined,” a dismayed Leona later\nrecounted. “The others were given instructions that Mary\nConnally and I emanated such terrible vibrations that they\nshouldn’t come near us or they’d be contaminated, and that\nwe were cheap, common people.\n“We did not understand it until afterwards, when we found\nout that practically everybody was told the same thing about\neverybody else, and no one felt that they could trust anyone.\nUsually they told you about some awful spirit that worked\nthrough different ones.”\nFor weeks, the pair continued working in the field. Was this\nbrutal labour a final attempt by Brother XII and Madame Z\nto force Mary to resign from the Work? Rumours that she was\neven yoked to a plow and made to till the field like an animal\nmake one wonder if the hard labour wasn’t part of a delib-\nerate plan to shorten her life.\nOne day, Mary was told by Madame Z that her work was\nfinished. From then on, she was considered by the other dis-\nciples to have been permanently downgraded in the Work.\nPerhaps to placate her, Brother XII gave her the job of re-\nceiving new arrivals to the colony. It was only later that Mary\nrealized she’d been misused. “They knew that the States was\nin a bad way and that I didn’t have any more money—and that\nthey had finished with me absolutely!” she declared.\n\nA Test of Obedience 291\nAt about the same time as Mary and Leona were returned\nto Cedar, the Barleys were also removed from Valdes Island.\nOn March 30, 1931, Madame Z popped her head in at the\ndoor of their cabin and informed them they had just twenty\nminutes to pack and get ready to be taken to DeCourcy Island.\nThey cooperated with “hearty good will,” as Alfred put it, since\nthe transfer to DeCourcy meant they’d been “promoted” in\nthe Work: “We felt honoured, for had we not ‘attained’?”\nOn DeCourcy, the Barleys were uncomfortably housed in a\nsmall, two-room cabin with the Crawfords—to say nothing of\ntheir dog. They tolerated the crowded living conditions in the\nhope that they’d soon be moved to a cabin of their own.\nInstead, ten days later, they were ordered back to Cedar.\nThe ostensible reason was that they could look after the prop-\nerty there, although Brother XII was already paying George\nHobart thirty dollars a month as caretaker. The Barleys re-\nalized they’d been “demoted,” that in some mysterious way,\nthey’d failed to measure up to Brother XII’s standards.\nThis fall from grace was disturbing enough, but to make\nmatters worse, they’d lost many valuable possessions as they’d\nbeen shuffled about from place to place. “The consequence of\nthese repeated and French-farce like moves,” Alfred recalled,\n“was that our belongings not only got disarranged, but mis-\nplaced, and some of them we never did locate as they passed\ninto general storage in a somewhat promiscuous way.”\nThere now followed a period of relative calm for the Barleys\nat Cedar. The disciples on Valdes and DeCourcy, however, con-\ntinued to be subjected to a regimen of hard physical labour.\nThe majority of them submitted to it without complaint, mo-\ntivated as they were by a spirit of discipline and devotion to\na cause. They had, after all, been warned in advance what to\nexpect when they came to the colony. \nThe Brothers’ School paper\nclearly stated: “The activities of the Great White Lodge can be\nsummed up in one word—WORK. This work is endless, never-\nceasing. . . Those who come to us will be expected to support\nour Work and our Cause TO THE UTTERMOST.”\n\n292 B R O T H E R X I I\nThe disciples believed that the hardships they endured were\ndictated by Brother XII’s zeal for the spiritual welfare of the\ncommunity. They continued to regard him, for the most part,\nin the best possible light. He was, as Alfred Barley expressed\nit, “the representative—the incarnation almost—of our ideal\nof this new brotherhood movement, which we believed was in\nthe process of being established.”\n\n293\nCHAPTER\nXI\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes\nO\nn a crisp morning in February 1931, Fermin Sepulveda\nand his twenty-one-year-old stepdaughter, Valea,\ncarried furniture out of their house in Monterey to\nthe four-wheeled trailer parked in the driveway. Inside their\ncomfortable home in Franklin Heights, his wife, Isona, and\nthe two younger children, fourteen-year-old Dion and his\nthirteen-year-old sister, Sereta, packed kitchen utensils into\nboxes and carried suitcases into the front hallway. After a last\nlook at the house, Isona and the children climbed into the\nModel T Ford, while Fermin gave a final tug on the ropes of\nthe fully loaded trailer. He then eased the car and trailer out\ninto the traffic on Franklin Avenue and the Sepulvedas began\ntheir journey to the Brothers’ Center.\nFermin and Isona had been secretaries of an Aquarian\nFoundation group in Monterey before they were summoned\nby Brother XII to British Columbia. Formerly an opera\nsinger, Isona had studied \nbel canto under Enrico Caruso and\n\n294 B R O T H E R X I I\nhad understudied Amelita Galli-Curci at the New York Met.\nAfter a series of tempestuous marriages ended her career,\nshe’d supported herself and her children as a singing teacher\nin Monterey. Her interest in metaphysics extended to an affair\nwith Dr. Frank L. Riley, a noted Theosophist; she’d accompa-\nnied him to Palmito del Verde, an island off Mazatlan, where\nthey collaborated on \nThe Bible of Bibles, a sourcebook of the\nworld’s religions. A handsome Castilian Spaniard, Fermin\nSepulveda was a resourceful and highly skilled handyman, with\na strong mystical inclination. He’d met Isona while attending\nher Theosophy classes in Pacific Grove and become her fourth\nhusband and a good stepfather to her three children.\nThe Sepulvedas did not proceed directly north to Canada.\nInstead, they followed the circuitous route which Brother\nXII had prescribed for them. First, they drove to Salinas,\nwhere they picked up an elderly walnut farmer named Edgar\nConrow, who slipped an attaché case full of bank notes under\nthe front seat. The little party then crossed the Sierra Nevada\nMountains, driving fifteen-hundred miles east to Bismark,\nNorth Dakota. Turning north, Conrow and the Sepulvedas\nentered Canada at North Portal, Saskatchewan, under ficti-\ntious names, telling the Immigration officials they planned to\nhomestead in the Peace River district of British Columbia.\n“Brother XII was paranoid,” Valea Sepulveda explains. “He\nshould have had us sprinkle twists of paper behind us, like the\nChinese do, to keep the evil spirits from following us. He prob-\nably thought that all the evil spirits in the world were going to\ntrace him to his lair!”\nBattling freezing temperatures and a howling blizzard, the\nSepulvedas headed west across the prairies. Blocked by a land-\nslide in the Rocky Mountains, they loaded their car and trailer\nonto a flatcar and proceeded by train to Revelstoke, where\nthey resumed their journey, driving down the Fraser River\nCanyon on a board road that hung precariously out over the\nprecipice. “There were boards missing from the road,” Dion\nrecalls, “so we packed our own two-by-twelve and every time\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 295\nwe came to a missing board, we stuck ours in.”\nWhen the Sepulvedas arrived in Vancouver, Fermin tele-\nphoned Frank Cunliffe’s office in Nanaimo and was told to\nsell the car and trailer and to convert everything the family\nhad brought into cash. Isona kept a few of her cooking uten-\nsils, but Fermin sold the remainder of their belongings at a\nfraction of their value. The Sepulvedas then boarded the ferry\nfor Nanaimo, where Bruce Crawford was waiting for them in\nthe \nKhuenaten.\n“I remember when we hit Cedar, the spring flowers were be-\nginning to come up,” Valea recalls, “and it was just beautiful\nthere. We stayed at Cedar for a day or two; then we were trans-\nferred to Valdes Island, starry-eyed.”\nOne night about a week later, the Sepulvedas and a number\nof other new arrivals at the colony assembled in the main\nmeeting hall on Valdes Island and turned over all their money\nto Brother XII. Included were the proceeds from the sale of\nthe Sepulvedas’ house in Monterey and the contents of Edgar\nConrow’s attaché case.\n“There was a wad of bills passed out there,” Valea exclaims.\n“I never saw so much money in all my born days! That table\nwas piled high with it, and it was all in cash.”\nIn the days following the meeting, Brother XII assessed the\nskills of the new arrivals and assigned them to different loca-\ntions in the colony. “He had a deliberate policy of separating\nfamilies,” Dion recalls. “If there was a tight family group, he’d\nbreak it up.” Isona Sepulveda and her two daughters, Sereta\nand Valea, were sent to the farm on the west side of DeCourcy.\nFermin went to the Point to build a sawmill at the head of the\nbay, while Dion was given a special task.\n“I had an interview with him, and he said he needed me\nbecause no one else could do the jobs he wanted me to do,”\nDion says. “He wanted me to be the cabin boy on the \nLady\nRoyal. It was flattery, pure flattery!”\nDion moved into Brother XII’s house at the Point and lived\nwith him and Madame Z almost as an adopted son.\n\n296 B R O T H E R X I I\n“Wilson wanted Dion,” Valea recalls. “He was the most good-\nlooking young chap you ever laid eyes on. He was a plum—an\nabsolute plum!”\n“My job on the \nLady Royal was clean-up duty,” Dion remi-\nnisces, “and he started at the basics with me. He taught me\nhow to scrub the ship, handle the ropes, take out the storm\nsails and air them in the sun. He taught me the rudiments of\nshooting a sun-line and a moon-line, and how to navigate by\nthe stars—all the stars I know the names of today are from that\ntime. He’d say, ‘Dion, break out the nine canvas!’ ‘\nYessir!’ And\naway I’d go, racing across the deck to show what I could do!”\nFor Dion, the experience gave him a sailor’s education that\nultimately led to a career in the United States Navy. He served\non submarines, rising rapidly through the ranks and retiring\nas a lieutenant commander after twenty-four years of sea duty.\nToday, he credits the training he received from Brother XII\nfor his success.\n“He was an absolute craftsman at sea who inspired confi-\ndence in anyone who was with him,” he says. “We frequently\ntook the Lady Royal out in inclement weather and it didn’t\nbother us a bit. He was not a man to shirk his duties—we ca-\nreened the \nLady twice while I was there. Although a lot of it\nwas hard work, it was exciting to a youth of fourteen.”\nBecause Dion lived in the same house as Brother XII and\nMadame Z, he had plenty of opportunity to observe them in\ntheir private lives, when they weren’t playing their roles as the\ncolony’s spiritual leaders.\n“Frequently, Z would visit my room to see that it was ‘ship-\nshape and Bristol fashion,’” he recalls. “She showed me how\nto make the bed and explained what my other duties were.\nShe was an awfully cold woman, though—I never could un-\nderstand how anybody could climb into bed with that gal! But\nhe did, so they must have had a pretty strong affection for\neach other in spite of their frequent quarrels.\n“Z was very strong-headed—she was like a Billingsgate fish-\nwife when she got mad! That was Z! One time, he put a box\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 297\nwith a long board on top of it outside a newly constructed\ncabin that needed a staircase. She stepped on the end of the\nboard and it kranged her kneecap. She flew into a rage at him\nfor putting it there. The argument ended up with Brother XII\nputting the board back and saying, ‘\nGoddamn it! Leave that\nboard there! \n’ Just an emotional display! Well, I witnessed all this\nand wondered about being at the feet of the Master!”\nValea Sepulveda worked at the farm on the west side of\nDeCourcy, taking care of the animals and doing farm work.\n“We were a slave troop,” she recalls. “I was five-foot-six, and in\nthe time I was there, I shrank three inches from heavy labour!”\nValea always did her best to avoid Madame Z. “I was her pet\nhate. She would lay us out in lavender when anything went\nwrong, and she was utterly despicable to the horses—she beat\nthem unmercifully!”\nValea was understandably shocked when her mother told\nher that she must have sex with Edgar Conrow, the elderly\nwalnut farmer who had accompanied them to the colony.\nIsona explained that everyone had been assigned a partner\nand that it was part of her initiation.\nThat night, Valea waited anxiously in her bed. When she\nheard footsteps on the stairs and saw the silhouettes of the\nmen coming into the dormitory, she jumped out of bed and\nslipped out the open window. She shinnied down a tree and\nran to the barn.\n“My partner was an older man,” she recalls, “and I admit I\nwasn’t too kind to him when he cornered me in the barn. He\ncame off second-best. I don’t know the details of their theory,\nbut it had something to do with the \nkundalini. They believed\nthey could achieve eternal youth through the sex act. I can\nguarantee you that there were some high times that went on\nthere! My escape route out the window and down that tree was\nthe only thing that saved my skin!”\nIsona Sepulveda was a volatile, highly-sexed woman, a se-\nductress who had broken up many homes. Fidelity wasn’t\nan issue between her and Fermin. Most men found Isona\n\n298 B R O T H E R X I I\nirresistible and Brother XII was no exception.\n“Brother XII invited my mother to visit him at the Point,”\nrecalls Valea. “The two were fascinated with each other. I know\nshe slept with him because she bragged about it—she was\nnever one to hide her affairs of the heart. She didn’t go into\nthe physical details too much, but she spoke of it as a great\nspiritual experience.”\nSereta was taken away from her mother and sent to Valdes\nIsland. Alone and unprotected, the innocent young girl was\nsexually assaulted by one of the disciples.\n“What really got me,” Valea recalls, “was when my little sister\nwas raped. The whole thing made me ill, because she was only\nabout thirteen at the time. She didn’t really understand what\nhad happened and she was a bit bruised up. I don’t know\nwhether it happened more than once or not, I only know of\nthe one time.”\nBrother XII soon tired of his affair with Isona Sepulveda.\nExasperated by her demands, he threatened to maroon her\non Ruxton Island without food or water.\n“Ruxton Island was Devil’s Island,” Valea explains. “It was\nthe jailhouse. There was a small cabin there and you survived\nif you could. I know of at least two people from the colony\nwho were sent there, and one of them never came back.”\nIn dread, Isona fled DeCourcy Island. The hysterical woman\nrowed ten miles across Stuart Channel to Chemainus. Cold\nand wet, she staggered up the beach to the small lumber town\nand ran, distraught, along the main street, before slumping\ndown exhausted on the veranda of the Green Dragon Hotel.\nWhen he discovered that she’d gone, Brother XII sent\nFermin and the children to Chemainus to bring Isona back.\nThey found her at the Green Dragon, and Fermin pleaded\nwith her to return with them to the colony. Isona refused.\nGrabbing Dion and Sereta, she swore to protect them and\nsaid she’d never permit them to go back to the island.\nFermin and Valea returned to DeCourcy to report to Brother\nXII, while Isona hurried to the local police station, where she\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 299\npoured out her story to Sergeant Hall. He drove her and the\ntwo children to Cedar, where Maurice Von Platen succeeded\nin calming Isona down enough so that she could give a co-\nherent account of what had happened. Von Platen then took\nher, Dion, and Sereta back to Chemainus, where he paid for a\nroom for them in the Green Dragon Hotel.\nThe next day, Sunday, May 25, Von Platen wrote to Attorney-\nGeneral R.H. Pooley, describing Mrs. Sepulveda’s experiences\nat the colony and asking the government to intervene on the\nfamily’s behalf:\nFrom her statement, the conditions at Valdes, and more\nstill, at the DeCourcy Islands, are unspeakable, but the\nspecific charge she makes are that her little daughter was\nattacked by a person named Bill, and was placed under this\nbrute’s orders, and that her boy was taken in by Wilson,\nand, according to his own statement, slept with Wilson and\nwas made the so-called Sun God, and completely alienated\nfrom her. This boy said last evening that he had another\ndisclosure to make which would put the man at the head\nof the colony under the law, but refused last evening to par-\nticularize, but said that the offence was of a nature against\nmorality. He will tell the police.\nThese people came here ostensibly as agriculturists, are\nentirely without funds, and as I am satisfied that their story\nis true, as it confirms the whole dirty mess brought out in\nthe hearing of my case against Wilson, I appeal to you to\ntake such steps as are in your power to assist them in blot-\nting out this cancer in the province.\nBrother XII evidently decided that he didn’t want Fermin\nor Valea at the colony after all, so he sent them to Chemainus\nto join the rest of the family. After a heated argument in the\nhotel room, Isona finally persuaded Fermin to make a state-\nment to the police.\nThe Sepulvedas were taken to Victoria by Sergeant Hall and\n\n300 B R O T H E R X I I\ninterviewed by Inspector Thomas W.S. Parsons of the B.C.\nProvincial Police. After obtaining separate statements from\neach of the family members, he concluded: “The allegations\nof Von Platen cannot be proved. There has been no impro-\npriety where the boy is concerned, but there seems to have\nbeen an unprovable indecency perpetrated upon the little girl\nby the man ‘Bill,’ a resident of Valdes Island.” Parsons recom-\nmended that the Department of Immigration launch a full\ninquiry and suggested that perhaps if the American principals\nof the colony could be deported, the colony would break up.\nThe Sepulvedas returned to the Green Dragon Hotel.\nExhausted by their interrogation, they went to bed early.\nBut Dion couldn’t sleep. He lay awake, wrestling with the\nfeeling that he must return to DeCourcy Island. Finally, he\nslipped out of bed, tiptoed past his sleeping stepfather and\ncrawled through the open window onto the roof of the ve-\nranda. Lowering himself off the edge, he dropped down to\nthe ground.\nDion ran down to the dock, where he picked out a likely-\nlooking fishing boat, started up the engine and cast off. He’d\nnearly cleared the harbour when a police launch cut him off—\nsomeone had seen him stealing the boat. Kicking and yelling,\nhe was dragged back to his family.\n“I’d been hypnotized,” he later explained. “Before I left\nDeCourcy, Roger Painter hypnotized me and gave me some\npost-hypnotic instructions to report back to him by any means\npossible. I fought the idea of going back to the hotel. I think\nmy step dad tied me up that night. Gradually, I was brought\nback to the realm of normality.”\nA few days later, Dion knelt in the prow of an Immigration\nvessel and guided it through the reef into the lagoon at\nDeCourcy Island. He acted as pilot against his will. “I felt very\nbad about it at the time,” he recalls. Dion stayed on board\nwhile the officers went ashore and walked up to Brother XII’s\nhouse. When there was no answer, they pushed open the front\ndoor and stepped inside. Brother XII and Madame Z had ap-\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 301\nparently fled, leaving everything behind. After wandering\nthrough the deserted rooms, the officers inspected the other\nhouses at the Point. They, too, had been hastily abandoned.\nLeaving the contents of the houses undisturbed, the police\nwithdrew.\nAfter the Immigration boat had gone, the colonists re-\nturned from their hiding places in the woods, and the life\nof the colony resumed. The police didn’t come back and no\ncharges were ever laid.\nBut now an astonishing thing occurred. The Sepulvedas ac-\ntually \nreturned to DeCourcy Island, reconciled their differences\nwith Brother XII, and were reinstated into the community.\nDion was taken back into Brother XII’s household and re-\nmained there for another year. He emphatically denies the\nallegations contained in Maurice Von Platen’s letter:\n“There was never any homosexuality on the part of Wilson.\nHe certainly made no overtures towards me; if he did, I would\nhave known it. I was never made the Sun God, and I never\nslept with Wilson—nor did I ever say I did.”\nOn the whole, Dion’s view of his relationship with Brother\nXII is remarkably positive. “He was more of a father figure to\nme than anything else,” he says. “He taught me a lot, espe-\ncially about sailing. My only regret is that we didn’t put out to\nsea more often in the Lady. I always thought he would have\nbeen good at training kids.”\nBrother XII had ended his affair with Isona Sepulveda, but\nhe continued to entertain other women at the Point. “He had\na number of overnight guests,” Dion recalls. “I just regarded\nthem as visitors. I don’t know for sure that he slept with them,\nbut afterwards, there’d be arguments between him and Z—\nshe seemed jealous.”\nr r r\nIn the spring of 1931, a young married couple named Alice\nand Carlin Rudy, both thirty years old, arrived at the colony\n\n302 B R O T H E R X I I\nfrom Chicago. Although Alice has no particular loyalty to\nBrother XII, she still defends him against his critics. “It was aw-\nfully hard on him because he could \nnot get the right people,”\nshe says. “They would not cooperate. They thought they knew\nwhat this work was about, and they didn’t know, and he could\nnot get through to them!\n“A lot of them, even my own husband, were unstable. They\nwere off the beam! They couldn’t keep it in the spiritual—\nthey brought it down to the mental, and then it drove them\nbugs!\n“Those Sepulvedas were the worst ones! Mrs. Sepulveda\nwas as crazy as a bed-bug! She was mental—she’d go into hys-\nterical fits! She took any kindness that you tried to show as\nsomething dirty. Like one night, the father didn’t come home\nuntil late. Dion was crying, so I put my arm around his shoul-\nders to comfort him. And she told Mabel that I was trying to\nseduce him—that’s the kind of mind she had!”\nBefore coming to the colony, Alice had worked for ten\nyears at the Marshall Fields department store in Chicago, sup-\nporting her husband while he tried his hand as an inventor,\nprospector, salesman, pianist, and poet.\n“He had a good job with the railroad, but he always quit it,”\nshe says. “They took him back five different times! Oh, he was\nalways going to invent something or find gold, or write some-\nthing, but he never did. Even his own mother told him, ‘One\nof these days, Alice is going to wake up and you’re going to\nlose your meal-ticket!’”\nBrowsing in a Chicago bookstore one day, Carlin found a\ncopy of \nThe Three Truths. He began writing to Brother XII,\nwho was so impressed with his letters, he invited Carlin and\nhis wife to the colony. “My husband corresponded with these\npeople for two years and I knew nothing about it,” Alice re-\ncalls. When Carlin announced that they were going to British\nColumbia, Alice didn’t object; she was so disillusioned with\nthe marriage, she felt anything would be better than their\npresent situation.\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 303\n“We didn’t put in a dime,” she recalls. “They sent us $385 in\nFargo, North Dakota, so we’d have enough money to get into\nCanada. My husband splurged all the way. He stayed in the\nbest hotels and ate in expensive restaurants. Even going over\non the ferry from Vancouver to Victoria, he went to the dining\nroom for a regular meal, while I went to the lunch counter for\na sandwich. ‘That isn’t your money,’ I said, ‘You have no right\nspending it!’”\nThe Rudys arrived in Chemainus, where they were met by\nMadame Z. “She and Carlin clashed from the start,” Alice re-\nmembers. “She was mad when she found out he’d spent all\nthe money they sent him. And when she told us the men and\nwomen slept in separate dormitories, he battled her on that!\n‘What kind of outfit is this,’ he said, ‘where a man can’t even\nsleep with his own wife?’”\nIt was soon apparent that Carlin wasn’t going to fit in at the\ncolony. He’d sleep late and have a leisurely breakfast, then\nspend the day under a shady tree reading a book, while the\nother men were busy putting up fences or building the goat\nbarn. Carlin’s contribution to the work was in the form of sug-\ngestions: “Why don’t you modernize? Get some generators in\nhere! Get some electricity!” He also asked the kinds of ques-\ntions that Mabel didn’t appreciate, such as, “Where does this\noutfit get its money?”\nAlice, on the other hand, had been raised on a farm and\nloved the work. “It was just what I needed! I’d been working\nin a department store for ten years, and my feet were broken\ndown from standing on a cement floor—I was taking electric\ntreatments on my feet every day. When I took my shoes off and\nwent barefoot in the warm earth, my feet got better. I loved it\nthere—it was like paradise!”\nThe Rudys were in Canada on a two-month visitors permit.\nWhen it expired, they had to leave. “Mabel knew I was un-\nhappy with my husband,” Alice recalls. “She took me aside\nbefore we left and said, ‘Get rid of him! He’s nothing but an\nanchor around your neck and that’s all he’ll ever be! I cannot\n\n304 B R O T H E R X I I\ntell you what to do or how to do it—just go and get rid of\nhim!’ She pinned some money in the cuff of my coat and said,\n‘You’re welcome to come back!’”\nIn Seattle, the Rudys checked into the New Richmond\nHotel. The next morning, as Alice recounts, “I said to him,\n‘Well, one of us has got to go to work, and I guess it’s going to\nbe me. I’m going downstairs to get a newspaper, so I can look\nfor a job.’ It was just like something took me by the shoulders\nand walked me over to the dock. I didn’t look back! I caught\nthe boat to Victoria; then took a bus to Nanaimo and a cab to\nCedar, where I stayed the night with Mary Connally.\n“The next morning, Bruce Crawford came over in the\nKhuenaten to pick up supplies, so I jumped on board and\nwent back to the island with him. When Wilson saw me, he\njust raised his eyebrows—he didn’t say a word!”\nWhen Alice didn’t return to the hotel, Carlin contacted the\nSeattle police and reported her missing. Realizing she’d prob-\nably gone back to the colony, he re-entered Canada, borrowed\na rowboat in Chemainus and rowed the ten miles to DeCourcy\nIsland.\nWord quickly spread across the island that Rudy had landed\nand was looking for his wife. When Roger Painter notified\nBrother XII that Carlin had returned, he had a fit. “Throw\nhim overboard!” he shouted. “Throw him off the cliff! Throw\nhim in the ocean! Drown him!”\n“We don’t do that kind of thing here!” Painter roared. Rudy\nwas seized, placed in an empty cabin and guarded all night. In\nthe morning, Bruce Crawford and Bill Lowell put him in his\nrowboat and towed it out into Stuart Channel. Rudy was set\nadrift off Yellow Point and with some difficulty made it back\nto shore.\nCarlin returned to Seattle, but kept bombarding Alice with\nletters. Most of them were intercepted by Madame Z, who\nscreened all the mail. “She always put a hex on the mail to\ntake away the outside vibrations,” Alice recalls. “I saw her put-\nting letters directly into the stove without even opening them,\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 305\nso I knew they were from him.”\nAlice admits she went through “an awful torment” leaving\nher husband, but says she’s always been grateful for Mabel’s\nadvice. “She did me the greatest favour of my life when she\ntold me to leave him, so I praise her!”\nAlice remained at the colony, becoming one of the most\nhard-working members of the community. “I’d get up at two\no’clock in the morning to get the washing out, so I could work\nin the garden,” she recalls. “I baked thirty-five loaves of bread\nat a time—whole wheat, but I had to make white for Wilson.\nWe canned a hundred quarts of vegetables a day. I planted\nsweet peas for the honey bees—and when those sweet peas\nbloomed, I was in heaven!”\nAlice prepared most of Brother XII’s meals. “I cooked\na lot of custards, junket, and rice pudding for him,” she re-\ncalls. “He’d had an operation in Italy and some of his digestive\norgans had been removed, so he had to eat real careful. I was\nthe only one he’d let take his meal in to him. He liked me be-\ncause I was impersonal. The others irritated him—they always\nhad to be so perfect for ‘The Brother.’”\nAlice remembers that Brother XII spent a great deal of time\nwriting. “He wouldn’t allow kids at the Point because they were\nnoisy. They’d disturb his concentration. One of them got hold\nof a tin pan one day and he was a-banging on it! Boy! Old XII\ncome out of there like a lion! Any noise, any vibration would\nbreak his spell!\n“He had a little water-spaniel named Topsy. She didn’t\nbark—she didn’t bother anyone. He loved Topsy. He kept\nchocolate candy for her—big boxes of chocolate drops. \nWe\ndidn’t get any chocolate candy! I used to steal some once in\na while and pass it around. And I used to steal his tobacco for\nthe boys. I’d fluff it up so he wouldn’t miss it. Here they were\ntrusting me—the only one they trusted in the house—and I\nwas swiping his tobacco!\n“He asked me once, ‘Do you know what this Work is about?’\nI said, ‘No,’ and he said, ‘Well, thank God, \none —just one is\n\n306 B R O T H E R X I I\nhonest! If the people who came here would just admit they\ndidn’t know, they’d have a chance to learn!’\n“What I couldn’t understand was why they were all so afraid\nof him. One night, we were at the supper table and I said to\neveryone, ‘You all act like a bunch of scared cats! What are you\nscared of? He’s only a human being! He’s only a man!’\n“‘\nWell, if we fail here, we’ll lose our souls! ’\n“I said, ‘Well, if I had a soul when I came here, I’m sure as\nhell going to have one when I leave! Anyway, \nI am a soul, so\nhow can I lose my soul?’\n“Afterwards, Mary Lowell dashed over to the Point and tat-\ntled on me. When Brother XII come down, I let him have it\nwith both barrels! I talked back to him as if he were no more\nthan— one of the goats there! They almost all fainted! ‘Why,\ndidn’t you realize you were talking right into the power-house?’ It\ndidn’t bother me none. They were so afraid to talk back to\nhim. They were like a bunch of puppets, like people you work\non strings—marionettes!”\nAlice admits, however, that Brother XII and Madame Z\npossessed powers beyond those of the ordinary person. “I re-\nmember once, Dion was racing up to the house to tell XII\nsomething—he was a little tattle-tale! Z didn’t want him to tell\nXII whatever it was, so she put her mind on that kid and he\nstopped—just like that! He turned around and started walking\nback. That’s how powerful she was.\n“She told me once, ‘ You’re the only one that’s ever been\nable to work with me.’ I liked her. I don’t care what anyone\nelse says, she was tops with me! I said to her once, ‘If only I\nhad your brains!’ She laughed. ‘You don’t need my brains. I’ll\nbe the brains; you just do the work!’ She wanted things done\nright. ‘I may not always feel like it,’ she said, ‘but I’m always\non the job!’\n“I asked her once why she was at the colony. She told me\nshe was there for what she could get out of it, for the knowl-\nedge XII had. ‘He has something I want,’ she said, ‘and I’m\ngoing to get it—even if it kills me!’”\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 307\nr r r\nThat summer, Brother XII did an unusual thing: he changed\nhis name to Amiel de Valdes. On June 25, 1931, the following\nnotice appeared in The British Columbia Gazette: “I, AMIEL\nDE VALDES, heretofore called and known by the name of\nEdward Arthur Wilson, of DeCourcy Island, British Columbia,\nhereby give public notice that on the 23rd day of March 1931,\nI formally and absolutely renounced, relinquished, and aban-\ndoned the use of my said name of Edward Arthur Wilson, and\nthen assumed and adopted and determined thenceforward\non all occasions whatsoever to use and subscribe to the name\nof Amiel de Valdes. . .”\nExactly six months later, on September 23, 1931, Madame\nZ changed her baptismal name of Edith Mabel Rowbotham to\nZura de Valdes.\nBrother XII and Madame Z took their new surnames from\nValdes Island, but why did Wilson choose the name Amiel?\nThe most likely explanation is that he identified, in some way,\nwith the Swiss essayist Henri Frederic Amiel, author of the cel-\nebrated \nFragments d’un journal intime, from which he’d quoted\nin \nThe Chalice.\nDid the name “de Valdes” symbolize Brother XII and\nMadame Z’s new relationship as a couple? The name change\nindicates that they participated in some kind of marriage\nceremony. For the disciples, however, life at the colony did\nnot change: Amiel and Zura de Valdes continued to rule their\nsubjects with an iron hand.\nr r r\nBy now, Brother XII had accumulated a huge sum of\nmoney from the monthly donations he continued to receive,\nas well as from the life savings of families like the Sepulvedas,\nwho had turned over everything to him. Most of the colo-\nny’s banking was done by Bruce Crawford, who made weekly\n\n308 B R O T H E R X I I\ntrips to Chemainus, Ladysmith, Duncan, and Nanaimo to\ncash cheques and convert funds into gold. American ten- and\ntwenty-dollar gold Eagles, although not in common use, were\nstill widely available at the time. Twice a month, Crawford vis-\nited banks in Victoria and Vancouver for the same purpose.\nAccording to Bruce McKelvie, Crawford later told him that\nhe’d handled $100,000 in the Chemainus account alone—an\nenormous amount, considering, for example, that a sawmill\nworker in the early 1930s earned thirty-five cents an hour or\nless. On one occasion, Crawford accompanied Brother XII\non the \nKhuenaten five hundred miles up the British Columbia\ncoast to Prince Rupert, where the two men bought gold di-\nrectly from the miners.\nBrother XII continued to store his gold using the unique\nmethod he’d devised earlier. At night in the kitchen of his\nhouse at the Point, he and Madame Z melted wax in sauce-\npans on the cast-iron stove, while stacks of gold coins glinted\nin the light of the kerosene lamp. Empty mason jars stood\non the table. Like alchemists in a medieval workshop, the two\nbent to their task, filling the jars with gold coins, then pouring\nmelted wax into each jar. The hot paraffin flowed into the\nspaces around the coins, dimming their lustre as it hardened\naround them. Like a priest and priestess presiding over an\narcane ritual, the pair repeated the procedure many times as\nBrother XII amassed a fortune in gold.\nBruce Crawford constructed cedar boxes to hold the jars.\nThe boxes were five inches square by nine inches deep, and\na jar of gold fitted snugly inside each. Brass screws held down\na wooden lid, and each box was equipped with rope handles,\nso that despite its weight it was easily portable. Crawford was\nrepeatedly pressed into service, usually in the dead of night,\ncarrying the boxes on and off the \nKhuenaten as Brother XII\ntransferred his hoard of gold from one secret cache to an-\nother. “He would bury it in one part of the island, and then\na few days later, he would dig it up again and take it to some\nother place,” Crawford recalled. Like a pirate captain fearful\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 309\nof losing his booty, Brother XII kept his treasure on the move,\nhoping to outwit a possible thief. Crawford never knew the\ntotal value of the gold, since he wasn’t permitted to handle it\ndirectly, but he estimated that the sum was a substantial one,\njudging by the number of boxes he made—forty-three in all.\nThe Barleys, meanwhile, had been transferred from Cedar\nto DeCourcy Island. Brother XII assured them that their res-\nidency there would be permanent and that, as Alfred put it,\n“further banging about from pillar to post (hitherto a regret-\ntable necessity) had now become a thing of the past.”\nBoth Alfred and Annie took part in the general work of\nthe colony, although Alfred’s tasks were considerably lighter\nthan those of the other disciples, since he wasn’t used to\nheavy labour. Most of the time, he worked as Roger Painter’s\nassistant, cutting wood for the stoves. Barley didn’t object to\nhis own work, which wasn’t demanding, but he often observed\nMadame Z zealously driving the other disciples, apparently\ntaking delight in making their lot an unhappy one.\n“In short,” as he later summed up life at the colony, “there\nwas the \nexploitation of willing service on the one hand, and\non the other, the \ndiversion and sequestration of funds from the\npurpose for which they were contributed. To put the whole\nmatter in a phrase, E.A.W. pursued the methods and exhibited\nthe spirit of the famous Mr. Squeers of Dotheboys Hall in his\nsystem of education: ‘W-i-n-d-e-r, Winder. Now go and clean\nthe winders. Then you’ll know what winder is.’”\nThe disciples still weren’t given any formal spiritual instruc-\ntion, although there was a strong emphasis at the colony on\nthe esoteric.\n“They gave you what they called your ‘inner name,’”\nAlice Rudy explains. “It was the name of your Higher Self—\nRamathiel, or Serathiel, or whatever. My inner name was Niadi.\nZ told me, ‘Never voice it out loud, but if you ever need help,\ncall on this name!’\n“They told me I was a young soul—only about a 3,500\n-year-\nold soul, which isn’t very old. Alfred Barley was an old soul.\n\n310 B R O T H E R X I I\nHe told me he’d never left the earth at some deaths—he just\ncame right back again into a new body. Roger Painter was\nSimon Peter in a past life, and XII was supposed to have been\nthe Apostle Paul.\n“He didn’t want anyone reading. One time, he saw me\nreading something and he said to Z, ‘What’s she reading? \nTake\nit away from her! I don’t want her reading anything!’”\nThere was one group ceremony that took place that summer\non a small island not far from the Point. Dion Sepulveda\nhelped to prepare the site. “We hauled some cement over to\nthis unnamed island and built a square wooden form,” he re-\ncalls. “Bruce Crawford and I mixed some concrete and poured\nit in to make this square cement block. Brother XII smoothed\nit off with a trowel and cut some mystical markings into it. A\nday or two later, when the cement had hardened, he painted it\nblack and marked off the twelve signs of the zodiac in a circle\naround it.”\nBrother XII chose twelve disciples to participate in the cere-\nmony. When he selected Alice Rudy, but not Isona Sepulveda,\nthe former \nprima donna was so jealous she went berserk. She\nscreamed and carried on so much that Roger Painter finally\npicked her up and tossed her into the ocean to cool her off.\nDion waded out to his mother and put his arms around her\nuntil she calmed down.\nBrother XII gave each of the disciples a short piece to mem-\norize for the ceremony. “Mine was something about Babylon,”\nAlice recalls. “I said to Bruce, ‘What’s mine about, anyway?\nExplain it to me!’ ‘Forget it!’ he said, ‘Just memorize it, that’s\nall!’ Roger said, ‘To heck with it! I’m not memorizing mine!\nI’m going to read it!’”\nThe evening of the ceremony, the disciples donned hooded\nblue robes and rowed over to the island. Dion placed a small\npile of dried moss and twigs on top of the cement block, while\nthe others took up their positions around the circle. Holding\na can of water underneath his robes, Dion then took his place\nbeside Brother XII. The ceremony opened with Brother XII\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 311\ninvoking the spirits from the four corners of the earth. At a\ncertain point in his delivery, he raised his arms and cried, “I\nnow call fire down! \n” This was Dion’s signal. He threw water\non the twigs and they burst into flame. As the fire leapt up,\nthe disciples gazed into the flames and solemnly recited their\npieces. At the end of the ceremony, they rowed silently back\nto DeCourcy Island.\nThe disciples were impressed by Brother XII’s control of\nthe elements. But in retrospect, Dion is sceptical. “It was an\neasy trick—he had white phosphorous in the damn stuff, I\nlater theorized!”\nAs the year 1931 ended, the diligence and hard work of the\ndisciples were impressively in evidence. They had cleared ten\nacres of land for vegetables, had planted an orchard—fruit\ntrees alternating with nut trees—and had built a giant store-\nhouse which they’d stocked with thousands of jars of home\npreserves. They had a dairy, greenhouses, a chicken house\nwith brooders and incubators. They’d purchased modern\nfarm equipment and had built a sawmill, so they could cut\ntheir own timber. Everywhere the disciples looked, they could\nsee the fruits of their labour. They felt proud, knowing they’d\nreached their goal of making the colony self-sufficient—they\nhad built their “City of Refuge.”\nIn the outside world, the Depression worsened. There were\neight million unemployed in the United States. In London,\nEngland, there were riots; and in Germany, Adolf Hitler was\ngaining power. As the world moved on its own timetable\ntowards Armageddon, Brother XII continued to predict di-\nsaster: “In the East, I see plagues greater than any yet known\nto man. In South America, tremendous inundations. In\nEurope, in the Eastern parts of this continent, the sky is red-\ndened with bloodshed. . .” In a secluded cove at the south end\nof DeCourcy Island, far removed from the political and social\nstrife of the outer world, Brother XII stood in a rowboat and\nlike an ancient Egyptian boatman used a single oar to propel\nhimself across the calm waters of the lagoon. “First the over-\n\n312 B R O T H E R X I I\nthrow—then the Silence—then THE RESTORATION. Think\nye on these things.”\nr r r\nEarly in 1932, an incident occurred which threatened the\nsecurity of the colony. In Seattle, Carlin Rudy talked to Alice’s\nuncle, Sidney Brashears, and gave him the impression Alice\nhad been kidnapped and was being held on DeCourcy Island\nagainst her will. Brashears called Alice’s mother in Missouri\nwho said she hadn’t received a letter from her daughter for\nnearly a year; before that, she’d been a faithful correspon-\ndent. A burly six-footer, Brashears armed himself with a gun\nand crossed the border into Canada, determined to find out\nif Alice was alright.\nBrashears arrived in Nanaimo in the last week of February\nand persuaded Sergeant Jack Russell and Customs Officer\nH.L. Good to accompany him to DeCourcy Island. As the\npolice launch neared the Point, it was spotted by one of the\ncolonists, who immediately ran to tell Brother XII. In a rage,\nhe stormed out of his house and put a powerful curse against\nAttorney-General Harry Pooley and the other members of the\ncabinet, who he believed had sent the launch. He kept cursing\nso violently for such a long time that the boat had already en-\ntered the bay before he suddenly turned and rushed into the\nwoods. Crashing through the underbrush, he flung himself\nface down in the salaal and lay motionless, swallowed up by\nthe forest floor.\nAlice scrambled up the ladder into the attic to hide, while\nMadame Z ran down the path to the beach. As the three men\nclimbed out of the boat, she greeted them with a torrent of\nabuse and demanded to see their search warrant. Even the de-\ntermined Brashears was stunned by Z’s ferocious tirade. Since\nthey didn’t have a warrant, the police had no choice but to re-\ntreat. As soon as the boat was gone, Z went up to Mary Lowell\nand burst into tears. “I didn’t know what I was doing,” she\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 313\nsobbed. “I had to do something to take their attention away\nfrom Alice—they might put me in jail!”\nWhen Brother XII returned from the woods, he and\nMadame Z put the ladder up and helped Alice down from\nthe attic. “That’s when they got thinking that maybe I’d better\nscoot,” Alice recounts, “because otherwise they could get into\na lot of trouble.” Brother XII took Alice to Chemainus in the\nKhuenaten. “He told me when I left that he hoped I could\ncome back,” she recalls. “And he said, ‘Keep yourself to your-\nself.’ What he meant, I don’t know. I think he meant stay away\nfrom Rudy.”\nAlice returned to Seattle, where she filed for a divorce from\nher husband. She says she has no regrets about the way things\nworked out, but nonetheless feels sorry for Carlin, who even-\ntually lost his mind. “He wanted to go back there, but they\ndidn’t want him. He didn’t realize that he didn’t fit in. They\nwanted workers, not freeloaders! He was living on Whidbey\nIsland, and he’d go down to the water when he saw a boat. ‘\nIt’s\nthem!’ he’d say. ‘They’re coming for me! ’ And he’d wade out into\nthe water and wave—that’s how crazy he was!”\nAlice claims that she never really understood the purpose\nof the group. “I asked Annie Barley afterwards, ‘What was it\nall about? What were you trying to do?’ She told me they were\ntrying to bring in a child, through one of the families there,\nwho would have the consciousness of a Jesus Christ, or some-\nthing to that effect. My husband knew about it. When we first\nwent there, he gave Mabel a present of a baby sweater, cap and\nbooties. Boy! She blew her top! I guess he wasn’t supposed to\nknow that!\n“What I didn’t understand was why she and Wilson wouldn’t\nbe the ones to have this child; they were the ones with the\nknowledge and the power. But I don’t know if Mabel could\neven have children—she hadn’t had any. And if Wilson could\nhave performed, why wouldn’t he?\n“And another thing—some of them had this crazy idea they\nwere going to live forever. They didn’t think they’d die in the\n\n314 B R O T H E R X I I\nphysical body. You can’t be too bright and think that! They\nwere always going to explain it to me—they were going to\nwrite it down—they were going to put it in a book—they were\ngoing to put it on tape—but they never did.”\nBrother XII now seemed to develop an almost pathological\nfear of the authorities. He ordered all other construction work\non DeCourcy Island halted and had the disciples build forts\nsurrounding his headquarters at the Point. Made of rocks,\nlogs and earth, they were cleverly camouflaged so as to be in-\nvisible from the water and showed a sophisticated grasp of\nmilitary tactics and engineering with their intersecting lines of\nfire. The fortification below Brother XII’s house was entered\nthrough a trapdoor in the ceiling. Once inside, the concealed\noccupant had a perfect view of the lagoon and could, as Roger\nPainter put it, “pop off” anyone coming into the harbour.\nThe colony’s arsenal consisted of a British .303 and a case of\ntwelve 6.5 mm Italian Mannlicher carbines, purchased by mail\nfrom the T. Eaton Company in Edmonton, plus a thousand\nrounds of ammunition. Brother XII kept six of the rifles in\na gun rack mounted on the wall of his office and distributed\nthe remaining weapons to those disciples he chose as guards\nto defend the colony.\n“I was rather disappointed in his attitude towards everybody,\nespecially the government,” Bill Lowell said later. “I asked him\nwhy he was building forts and he said, ‘None of your damned\nbusiness! You are too inquisitive!’ Afterwards, he came around\nand explained that it was for the protection of the people who\nwere there and those who would come after, and that a time\nwas coming when his enemies would come to the island to try\nto get him, and he didn’t want to be taken by surprise.”\nAs part of the defensive measures, Brother XII tried to block\nnavigation between Link Island and DeCourcy Island by dyna-\nmiting a tree across the narrow channel that separated them.\nHe told Bill Lowell to accompany him to the “Hole-in-the-\nWall,” as it was called, and put twenty-five sticks of dynamite\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 315\nin the tree’s roots. When Lowell pointed out that the charge\nwouldn’t topple the tree, but would only blow the dirt out into\nthe water, Brother XII swore at him and asked him if he was\ngoing to obey. “I would like to have one man in this colony I\ncan depend on!” he said. Lowell put the dynamite in the tree’s\nroots and detonated it. As he’d predicted, the charge blew the\ndirt out into the water and the tree shuddered, but remained\nstanding. After the blast, there was an explosion of another\nkind as Brother XII swore mightily because the tree didn’t fall\ninto the water.\nBrother XII even issued written instructions to the dis-\nciples, “Details for Point Defence,” which outlined the\nprocedures to be followed in guarding the colony. Sentry duty\nwas in four hour shifts, at 8:00 A.M., 12:00 noon, and 4:00\nPM. The women walked from fort to fort, scanning the water\nfor suspicious craft, particularly government vessels, while the\nmen defended the forts, ready to repel any intruder. Most of\nthe disciples didn’t take Brother XII’s militarism seriously,\nhowever. Roger Painter scoffed at it. “We all considered it a\nbig joke,” he said; while Annie Barley noted, “He had a mania\nabout that sort of thing. I took it that he was a bit crazy on it\nand I did it to keep him quiet.” But even so, the guards were\nconscientious in the discharge of their duties, warning off en-\ncroaching vessels and occasionally even firing upon curious\nor unwary boaters who strayed too close to the island’s shores.\nThe colony had become an armed camp.\n“Brother XII seemed to be preparing for an invasion,” Dion\nSepulveda recalls. “He built gun emplacements and we did\nguard duty for him. But about this time of year, things started\ncoming apart at the seams. Brother XII and Madame Z con-\nstantly quarrelled. Painter was called over to the Point more\noften—and, well. . . there was trouble!”\nDion thinks that part of the problem was Roger Painter.\n“He was not the Skipper, but he was at least a Third Mate. He\nassumed a lot of power and he moved people around. Brother\nXII would give him orders, but he wouldn’t obey them. Well,\n\n316 B R O T H E R X I I\nsometimes he would and sometimes he wouldn’t. And it was\na monument to Brother XII’s own lack of captaincy that he\ndidn’t haul Painter before the mast and say, ‘Dammit! You’re\nfired!’”\nThe Sepulvedas decided to leave the colony while they could.\nFermin talked to a local fisherman and arranged for him to\ntake them off DeCourcy under cover of darkness. One night,\nat the appointed time, they all hurried down the path to the\nbeach as a boat slipped quietly into the bay. The Sepulvedas\nclambered aboard and were soon chugging across Stuart\nChannel towards the lights of Chemainus—and freedom.\nThe next day, Fermin gathered Isona and the children\naround him. “We’re going to stay in British Columbia,” he\nsaid. “We’re going to be a family again.” With some financial\nhelp from Maurice Von Platen, the Sepulvedas bought a piece\nof land near Ladysmith, which they farmed for several years\nbefore eventually returning to California.\nDion Sepulveda looks back upon his days at the colony with\nmixed feelings. Although it was an idyllic time for him in many\nways, he now views Brother XII in a much different light than\nhe did then. His judgment of him today is a harsh one:\n“My life with Brother XII was a normal, everyday life in which\nhe was a normal, everyday individual. There was never any\ntalk of the Master’s work, or of the Master’s teachings. I lived\nclose enough to him to see that his demonstrating himself to\nhis students was completely false. He was a false personality\nto them, which he dropped like a dirty shirt as soon as he was\nback at the Point. But he knew his teaching well, and he was\nall things to all persons within that teaching—he could mas-\nquerade to anyone. To the vegetarians on the island, he was a\nvegetarian. He was no vegetarian! Hell, he had the best cuts of\nmeat money could buy! Every ten days, Bruce Crawford and I\nwould go into town with a shopping list and spend hundreds\nof dollars on food items alone—caviar, gourmet items! No,\nthey didn’t talk about the teachings at the Point; they were\nmore worried about their next trip to Nanaimo and getting a\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 317\nload of cigarettes—they were all chain-smokers! But if they got\nsomeone over to the Point who they wanted to impress, that\nwas different. Then they would talk in the mystical languages.\nVery clever man, Wilson—he could represent himself as any-\nthing. But it was obvious he didn’t believe in the teachings.\nHow could he? He was gaining worldly goods from teachings\nwhich said you had to give up your worldly goods! There’s a\ncontradiction right there! A person who believed in the teach-\nings would have put the cabin boy on some kind of regimen\nof learning. Never! It was never attempted! I know nothing\nabout the teaching. Crawford knew nothing about it except\nhow it was being used. Painter laughed at it! He and Bruce\nwould drink beer in Nanaimo and laugh up a storm about\nhow this was really the con of cons—the biggest con game of\nall time! And it is—in the hands of artists like E.A. Wilson!”\nr r r\nAfter the Sepulvedas left DeCourcy Island, life at the colony\nrapidly deteriorated as Brother XII and Madame Z placed even\ngreater demands upon the disciples. “No slaves ever worked\nharder than the people at the farm,” Annie Barley exclaimed.\n“And they couldn’t work without being sworn at and cursed.”\n“Anybody that came into the harbour, there was some tirade\ncaused,” Roger Painter said. “He would order us to drive them\nout, threatening to ram them with the tug if they didn’t get\nout of the harbour. We were sent out to order them off. He\nwould stand on the shore cursing away, and I would row out\nin the boat and say, ‘The Captain doesn’t want you in the har-\nbour—will you get out!’”\nMadame Z’s behaviour was also becoming increasingly ir-\nrational. “She came to me at Cedar once and accused me of\ndoing things I had never done,” Mary Connally recalled. “She\nsaid I had taken the car and had acted contrary to instruc-\ntions, and that I should not be allowed to take the car and it\nwas locked up. We never took the car out except on orders.\n\n318 B R O T H E R X I I\nShe gave the orders herself what was to be done. She would\ntell them to go to Chemainus to get material—and then she\nwould run up and down the room like someone that was\ncrazy. She would throw up her hands and shout, ‘\nFools! Fools!\nDamned fools! They have gone to Chemainus and I need the car! ’\nWell, they had gone to Chemainus entirely on her orders—\nand that was the first time I thought there must be something\nabsolutely wrong.”\nZ was especially cruel to the women of the colony. Georgia\nCrawford worked in the fields from two o’clock in the morning\nuntil ten o’clock at night. When she fell down from sheer ex-\nhaustion, Z would rouse her to fresh efforts with her curses.\nOne of Georgia’s jobs was working in the potato warehouse, a\nshed nine feet by fifteen feet, where she had to sort and stack\none-hundred-pound sacks of potatoes piled three tiers high to\nthe ceiling. It was brutal work and after three days she couldn’t\ngo on. She was then given the job of goatherd. Following her\ncharges over the steep terrain of DeCourcy Island, she fell and\nhurt her knee, which swelled up to twice its normal size and\ncaused her excruciating pain. But Z refused to let her rest or\nminister to the injured limb, and when Georgia was an hour\nlate getting the goats back into their pen, she was banished to\nValdes Island.\n“I had to gather my things together and walk over the bush\ntrail with them on my back,” she later explained. “It was agony.\nThe pack was heavy and I had to sit down every few feet to rest\nmy knee. The tug was going around in the afternoon, but I\nwas refused permission to put my things on it. I fell every three\nor four steps. Then I had to row from the Point to Valdes.”\nAnother time, Georgia was given the job of painting a shed\nthat was built out over the edge of a cliff. She painted the\nthree outer walls, but could only paint the wall facing the\nsea by hanging on precariously with one hand and reaching\naround with the other—risking serious injury should she fall\nto the rocks twenty feet below.\nWhy did Georgia submit to such treatment? “I had to do it,”\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 319\nshe explained. “I did not want to be parted from my husband.\nI had been parted from him for six weeks earlier—and I did\nnot want my soul destroyed.”\nBrother XII’s writings had described a colony of brotherly\nlove, where members would live in an atmosphere of truth\nand honesty, and where only a voluntary discipline would pre-\nvail. But the conditions at the Brothers’ Center were exactly\nthe opposite.\n“I wasn’t there long until I found out I wasn’t in a brother-\nhood of love,” Bruce Crawford said later, “but in a brotherhood\nof hell. The only time I saw a live brotherhood was during the\neleven months that he was away, because after they came back\nand set up their rule and government, there was nothing but\nblasphemy and cursing and contradictory orders. It seemed\nimpossible to do anything to please them. I often wondered\nwhether that long sea-trip didn’t render them somewhat\ninsane or something, because I never saw such actions.”\nAnnie Barley also noticed that Brother XII appeared to\nbe quite a different man from the charming gentleman she\nand her husband had first met in Southampton. “We often\nwondered if they didn’t put on a show for us, especially at\nfull moon,” she recalled. “It was either that they were insane\npeople or that they were taking drugs.”\nThe hapless disciples who incurred the displeasure of either\nof the colony’s leaders would receive the full force of their\nfury. Arms upraised, Madame Z would stamp up and down in\nfront of the wretched offender, calling down “The Power” to\nsmite the object of her wrath.\n“I saw him stand and curse those people,” Annie Barley re-\ncalled, “and when they got away from him, one by one, he\nwas left there standing and cursing with his hand up, until he\ncouldn’t speak. He would go back trembling to the house with\nhis voice gone—and that was the occurrence ten times a day,\npretty nearly every day.”\nWhy did the disciples stand for such abuse? “You stood for it\nfor this reason,” Crawford later explained. “Each one in turn\n\n320 B R O T H E R X I I\nwas supposed to be loyal, and it was such a mental dominance\nfor the sake of loyalty that if you raised your hand to protest\nany order, you might be separated from your wife or immedi-\nately deported from the island, and you would be destitute in\na strange country.”\nThe disciples were even subject to food rationing. A slice\nof brown bread with a spot of jam and one teaspoonful of tea\nto twenty gallons of water was the typical daily ration. When\nthe disciples came over to Cedar to work, they were ravenous.\nMary Connally took food out to them while they worked in\nthe fields. “I thought it was the most terrible thing in the\nworld to work people like that—without food,” she recalled.\n“They were almost in the condition they would have stolen\nfood, they were so hungry.”\nMary was horrified by the stories the disciples told of con-\nditions on DeCourcy Island: “They were told to kick men\nand throw them in the water, and if they didn’t do absolutely\nas they were told, they were sent off the island without any\nmoney. These people had given everything that they had—\nand they were sent out stripped.”\nIt was not until one after another of the disciples were cast\nout and those remaining realized, as Barley put it, “that this\nmight go on indefinitely, until \nall had been made to run the\nplank in this way, and the Skipper left alone on the ship with\nhis cronies and the booty, so to speak, that joint action became\nan imperative necessity.”\nThe crisis came with the appalling treatment of Sarah\nPuckett. The seventy-eight-year-old retired San Francisco\nschoolteacher was told by Madame Z that she must drown her-\nself by falling backwards out of a rowboat, so that her spirit\ncould return to the colony and report on the afterlife. Sarah\ntook this bizarre assignment seriously. For three consecutive\nevenings, she allowed herself to be rowed up and down in the\ndeep waters off the Point. But each time she tried to throw\nherself backwards out of the rowboat, she was unable to do so\nbecause she failed to hear “the little voice” that she believed\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 321\ncalled every good Christian to heaven when it was his or her\ntime to die. At the end of her third macabre cruise, Madame\nZ heaped such abuse upon Sarah for failing to do her duty for\nthe cause that the despairing woman broke down and wept.\nThe conditions at the colony were now so dreadful that\nthe disciples asked Barley to draft a letter for them to Brother\nXII. Alfred drew up what was in effect a “Declaration of\nIndependence,” which was signed by nine of the disciples and\npresented to Brother XII on May 15, 1932:\nTo The Brother, XII:\nThere has for some considerable time past been a growing\nsense of dissatisfaction and bewilderment at the conditions\nof life on this island—or rather, one should say, at the\nmethods of administration pursued by the two responsible\nheads. This now growing to a climax, the possibility is fore-\nseen of any one, or all of us, on some occasion which proves\nthe “last straw” suddenly leaving self-restraint and taking\naction that later might be regretted. We therefore ask that\na meeting be called at which all shall be present, and an\nexplanation given which will render existing conditions tol-\nerable, or, alternatively, an assurance that the state of things\nwhich we find unendurable shall come to an end.\nBrother XII read the letter and was outraged that his ac-\ntions should be questioned. He refused to hold the meeting.\nInstead, he interviewed each of the disciples separately and\ntried to create dissension within the group. Even now, some of\nthe disciples were inclined to regard his refusal to meet with\nthem as one more test of their earnestness.\nTwo weeks later, on the evening of June 1, Brother XII in-\nvited Mary Lowell and Edric Agate to his house since he’d\ndrawn up a new will that he wanted them to witness. In the\nevent of his death, everything would be left to Zura de Valdes.\nAfter he’d read the will aloud, the two signed it. Then Agate\nsaid goodnight and Mary went upstairs to sleep.\n\n322 B R O T H E R X I I\nAt two o’clock in the morning, Madame Z came into Mary\nLowell’s room and woke her up. “Mary,” she said, “now that\nI’ve got everything in my name, I’m going to get rid of that\noutfit at Cedar and that outfit at the Point. I’m going to have\nthings my way!”\nBrother XII came in and sat next to the bed. He obviously\nwanted Mary’s sympathy. “I’m going to run all these people\noff,” he said. “They’re no good!” He proceeded to denigrate\nthe disciples, calling them vile names, and ended the conver-\nsation by saying, “There will be no one left except Agate and\nmyself. He would like to have a woman here. I want you to\npromise to stay.”\nMary was shocked by the request. “Why, I couldn’t make\nsuch a promise,” she replied. “I couldn’t leave my husband.”\nThe following day, Brother XII invited Annie Barley to his\nhouse for tea and during the visit told her he was concerned\nabout her future. “If Alfred should die or become sick, have\nyou any means of your own by which you would be able to\nlive?” he asked. When she said she hadn’t, he offered her the\nCedar property, so that she’d have something that could be\nturned into money. Annie was suspicious of the offer, knowing\nhow cunning Wilson could be, and said she’d have to think\nit over. “If you would accept it, my mind would be very much\nrelieved,” he said, before saying goodbye to her in a most\nfriendly manner.\nAfter discussing the offer with Alfred, Annie decided to\naccept it, even though the property was a financial liability\nsince the taxes were heavy and hadn’t been paid that year.\nAnnie reasoned that if the disciples were thrown off\nDeCourcy Island, they’d be destitute in a foreign country and\nwould need a home—the property would provide one. The\nnext morning, she informed Brother XII of her decision and\nhe executed the papers giving her title to the land.\nA few days later, Brother XII began taking the disciples to\nCedar in the \nKhuenaten, two or three at a time. It would be\nthe last they would ever see of him. Only a few loyalists, such\n\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes 323\nas Agate and Harold Krause, remained on DeCourcy. The\nBarleys were the last to leave. “We were sent away a little more\ncourteously than the others,” Annie observed, “but still we\nwere sent.”\nThe colony on DeCourcy Island was now deserted—its\nhouses vacant, its machinery idle. The sun beat down on the\nfarm, with its abandoned buildings and desolate fields. The\nwind rustled the dry grass. At the Point, the waters lapped\ngently against the sandstone ledges of the lagoon as the \nLady\nRoyal rode at anchor, her sails hanging listless in the heat.\nBrother XII’s dream had ended in the silence of a summer’s\nafternoon and the solitude of a deserted community.\nOn the morning of June 5, 1932, the disciples gathered in\nthe auditorium of the Center Building at Cedar. The atmos-\nphere was charged with emotion as they openly discussed, for\nthe first time, the extent of Brother XII’s tyranny over them,\nand the fear and oppression that had ruled their lives. As they\nshared their experiences, they gained strength, and by the\nend of the meeting they had made a decision: they would stay\ntogether as a group and carry on the Work to which they’d\ndedicated their lives—but without Brother XII.\n\n324\nCHAPTER\nXII\nRule Thou the Shadow\nI\nn the law offices of Harrison and McIntyre on Bastion\nStreet in Nanaimo, Victor B. Harrison was working at his\ndesk when his secretary opened the frosted-glass door and\nannounced that a delegation from the Aquarian Foundation\nwas there to see him. Led by Roger Painter, the half-dozen\nmembers of the group crowded into Harrison’s office, where\nthey stood nervously for a moment before Painter announced\nthat they wanted Harrison to represent them in a court action\nagainst Brother XII.\nThe disciples immediately launched into an account\nof how Brother XII had defrauded them. Mary Connally\nexplained that she’d given him twenty-three thousand dol-\nlars after spending only a few hours with him in a Toronto\nhotel; Barley said he wished to sue for the return of the money\nhe’d contributed, since he hadn’t intended it for Wilson’s per-\nsonal benefit, but for the common welfare of the community.\nHarrison wrote everything down and assured the disciples\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 325\nhe’d fight for them.\nA few days later, Harrison drove out to Cedar to meet with\nthe group again. As they’d instructed, he brought with him\nthe young daughter of a mutual friend, since the disciples be-\nlieved the presence of a child would somehow protect them\nfrom Brother XII’s influence.\nWhen Harrison and the girl arrived, they were hurriedly\nushered into the Center Building through the back door.\nPainter explained that Brother XII had a spyglass and might\nbe watching Cedar from DeCourcy. During the meeting, he\nkept going nervously to the window to see if a boat was coming\nover from DeCourcy Island.\n“I was only about thirteen or fourteen years old at the time,”\nremembers Roma Conroy. “It was quite an experience to see\ngrown people terrified. I’ve never seen anything like it—the\nfear on the faces of these people. They were terrified of what\nhe might do.”\nThe disciples told Harrison about a mysterious house that\nBrother XII had built high up in a towering fir, so cleverly\nconcealed no one would suspect it was there. He would re-\ntreat here for days at a time to meditate. Harrison wanted to\nsee the house, so the group started out for the tree. As they\napproached it, Bill Lowell became so weak he could hardly\nwalk.\n“He couldn’t keep on his feet,” Harrison recalled. “He\nalmost sat on the ground. And he kept looking back towards\nDeCourcy Island, which you could easily see from Cedar. I’m\nconvinced he was under the influence of hypnosis—he must\nhave been.”\nWhen the group arrived at the tree, the disciples drew back,\novercome by fear.\n“Come on, follow me up!” Harrison exhorted them. “Don’t\nbe afraid! We’re in a lawsuit now; we have to show the court\nwhat this is all about!”\nHarrison climbed up the wooden steps nailed to the trunk\nand disappeared into the branches of the tree. He climbed\n\n326 B R O T H E R X I I\nhigher and higher until he finally reached the house. Opening\nthe door, he stepped into a large wooden room that was empty\nexcept for a metal bedstead and mattress in one corner. On\nthe wall, there hung a framed copy of “The Invocation of\nLight.”\nBruce McKelvie, now the managing editor of \nThe Victoria\nColonist, \nwas in Ottawa at the time, reporting on the Imperial\nEconomic Conference. He received a letter from Harrison,\ntelling him he’d been retained by two of the disciples to file suit\nagainst Brother XII. McKelvie returned to Victoria and waited\neagerly for news that the cases had been officially filed. The\nweeks passed and he heard nothing further. He finally drove\nto Nanaimo to ask Harrison what was causing the delay.\nAs McKelvie recounts in his book \nMagic, Murder, and Mys\ntery, \nthe lawyer gloomily explained that he couldn’t get the\ndisciples to proceed with their cases.\n“Why?” asked McKelvie.\n“Do you remember that case in the police court in 1928,\nand how England’s lawyer fainted?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s it: they say that he was knocked over by the black\nmagic of Egypt, and they’re afraid that if they start action,\nthey’ll all be killed by similar dark powers. Then there was the\ndisappearance immediately after of Bob England—and that\nhas never been explained.”\nA few days later, McKelvie drove to Cedar-by-the-Sea with\nhis twenty-year-old nephew, Neil McKelvie, to meet with the\ndisciples. They were conducted into the auditorium, where\ntwo chairs were placed against a blank wall and twelve more\narranged in a semi-circle around them. Everyone sat down\nand the disciples proceeded to tell McKelvie of the manner in\nwhich Brother XII had treated them.\n“There is nothing wrong with the religion,” they repeat-\nedly stressed. “It is sound and true. It’s Wilson; and the only\nthing we can believe is that he’s not himself, that the powers of\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 327\ndarkness have taken control of him.”\nNeil McKelvie was struck by the mental and emotional state\nof the group. “They seemed to be in a trance, or as if they had\njust awoken from a deep sleep,” he recalls. “They looked like\nzombies with their haunted eyes. They were so fearful, they’d\nalmost jump if you raised your voice. They were virtually ap-\npealing to my uncle to help them in some way.”\n“I understand you are afraid of Brother XII’s magic?”\nMcKelvie asked, looking around the half-circle of frightened\nfaces.\n“Yes,” answered Painter.\nAnother member broke in: “Do you know he tried to kill\nMary Connally with black magic last Tuesday, but we knew of it\nthrough occult means. She left her house and spent the night\nwith Mrs. Barley. Bruce Crawford slept in her house and all\nnight he had to wrestle with the black influence!”\n“Yes,” admitted Crawford. “In the morning, I was mentally\nand physically exhausted; I have hardly recovered yet.”\nMcKelvie looked at the distressed disciples. He realized\nhe’d have to come up with an ingenious solution to help them\nconquer their fear.\n“This is Egyptian magic, isn’t it?” he challenged them.\n“Yes,” answered Painter, “the most virulent kind.”\n“Pooh!” McKelvie snorted, snapping his fingers. “You’ve\nforgotten the first principle of magic!”\nPainter and the others immediately sprang to their feet, de-\nmanding to know what he meant.\n“I mean just what I say,” McKelvie declared. “Don’t you\nknow that where there is magic native to the soil, no foreign\nmagic has any potency?”\nThe disciples looked at him, speechless.\n“And here you are,” McKelvie continued, “living on one of\nthe sacred grounds of the Cowichan Indians. Here, they made\ntheir magic. Here, they made their medicine. Here, the young\nmen went through their warrior tests. Ye gods, the very ground\nis impregnated with magic! \nAs long as you are here, nothing in\n\n328 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe world can harm you!”\nThe disciples stared at McKelvie, stunned by this revelation;\nthen a look of tremendous relief flooded across their faces\nand they all crowded around him, expressing their profound\ngratitude.\nMcKelvie and his nephew returned to the car. Roger\nPainter was the last one to say goodbye and he assured the\nreporter that the disciples would now proceed with the law-\nsuits. McKelvie drove away, delighted with the outcome, while\nNeil curled up in the back seat and fell into a deep sleep, ex-\nhausted by the experience.\nOn September 24, 1932, Mary Connally filed a claim against\nBrother XII, now legally known as Amiel de Valdes, in the\nSupreme Court of British Columbia for $42,100, plus $10,000\nin personal damages. She named Zura de Valdes as a co-defen-\ndant in the suit. Mary charged that all of their representations\nto her were completely false and were part of a scheme “to\ndeceive, ensnare, and delude the plaintiff of her money, prop-\nerty, and labour.”\nOn November 7, 1932, Alfred Barley also filed suit against\nAmiel and Zura de Valdes, suing them for $14,232; he claimed\nhe’d been the victim of a confidence game.\nThree months later, on February 2, 1933, Wilson filed his\ndefence. He denied the allegations made against him and\nasserted that the funds of the two plaintiffs had been given vol-\nuntarily and had only been used by him in the furtherance of\nthe work upon which he was engaged. He stated that his books\nand other writings were “written under the overwhelming in-\nspiration of spiritual forces, and were only intended for those\nwhose consciousness of spiritual realities would permit them\nto read with understanding.”\nIn the period immediately preceding the court cases,\nBrother XII initiated a new series of psychic attacks against the\ndisciples. Kaye Kirchner, a Seattle mechanic and one of the\ntwelve disciples banished from DeCourcy Island, was a victim.\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 329\n“I was paralyzed by Brother XII for six weeks,” he later told\nToronto Star reporter Alexandrine Gibb, “and walked around\nlike a drunken man for that time.”\nGibb also talked to Arthur O’Sullivan, a brawny workman\nfrom Lethbridge, Alberta. “I was trying to follow the henchman\nof Brother XII around,” he told her. “I thought if I tagged this\n‘Black Agate,’ as they call him, I’d find his Master. I saw him\nget on the boat for Vancouver, and when I went to get into\nmy car, I was suddenly stricken. It was just as if I’d been hit on\nthe head. I couldn’t drive: my arms were dead, my head felt\nthe size of a balloon. I was paralyzed by the power of black\nmagic. It didn’t leave me for an hour, and for days I had a sore\nhead.”\nOn the morning of April 26, 1933, the disciples arrived at\nthe court house in Nanaimo for Mary Connally’s case against\nBrother XII. There in the front row of the courtroom they saw\nthe “Black Dupe,” Edric Douglas Agate.\nIn \nMagic, Murder, and Mystery, Bruce McKelvie described\nthe role he played in helping the disciples overcome their fear.\nAs he entered the court house to report on the day’s proceed-\nings, Victor B. Harrison came running up to him.\n“Good Lord!” the lawyer exclaimed. “I can’t get them into\nthe witness box!”\n“What’s the matter?” asked McKelvie. “Brother XII hasn’t\nturned up, has he?”\n“No, but it’s this damned Egyptian magic again! They say\nthat Wilson has a satellite here who has thrown a spell around\nthe witness box, and if anyone of them steps into it, he’ll\ndie!”\nMcKelvie thought for a moment, then realized his mistake:\nhe’d localized the disciples’ protection from Brother XII’s\nmagic to Cedar-by-the-Sea.\n“Can you hold the Judge for ten minutes?” he asked.\n“I think so,” Harrison replied, starting for the magistrate’s\nchambers, while McKelvie dashed across the street to the\nMalaspina Hotel. He remembered that in his luggage he had\n\n330 B R O T H E R X I I\na double labret, or lip ornament, worn by the women of the\nQueen Charlotte Islands when the white man first came to the\nPacific coast.\nGrabbing the bit of stone, McKelvie puffed back to the\ncourthouse. He met Roger Painter in the corridor, pulled him\ninto an empty witness room and shut the door.\n“See this, Roger?” he asked, cupping his hands around the\nlabret.\n“Yes, what is it?” Painter inquired, peering at the curiously-\nshaped ornament.\n“It’s the greatest charm on the coast,” McKelvie assured\nhim. “It used to belong to the most famous of Haida medicine\nwomen. As long as you are in association with that, no power\nunder heaven can hurt you!”\nPainter’s face lit up. “Lend it to me,” he begged.\n“Lend it. Lend it? Why, man, I’d almost as soon lose my life\nas to lose that!”\n“Oh, lend it to me!” Painter pleaded.\n“How long?”\n“Just for this case.”\n“Well, swear I’ll get it back,” McKelvie ordered.\nPainter went down in a deep bow and solemnly pledged to\nreturn the labret at the end of the trial. McKelvie handed it\nover to him and he hurried away to inform the others.\nEvery witness, according to McKelvie, entered the witness\nbox holding the labret, looked Agate straight in the eye and\ndelivered their testimony.\nThe trial proceeded. On the stand, Mary Connally testified\nbefore Chief Justice Aulay M. Morrison that Brother XII had\nbroken his trust and proved himself unfit for the Work he had\nset out to do for humanity:\n“He did not fail until he came back from Europe, and when\nhe came back, he started fooling us fast, until he smashed up\neverything that was capable of being smashed. It took him one\nyear and six months to absolutely demolish everything and it\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 331\nwas that demolishing, and the diabolical manner in which he\ndid it—not only to me, but to others with me—that has made\nme come here and demand that those lands which were pur-\nchased for a certain purpose and a certain work be returned\nto us who are now living together at Cedar.”\n“What is his nationality?”\n“He is an Englishman by birth. He doesn’t look like an\nEnglishman, though.”\n“How old a man is he?”\n“He is fifty-four or fifty-five, I think. He is very swarthy,\nvery dark. He is very much like the exhibited pictures of\nMephistopheles.”\nWhen Harrison asked about Zura de Valdes, Mary explained\nthat she lived with Wilson as his secretary and housekeeper.\n“Doing general utility work?”\n“Yes, bossing everything. He hid behind her skirts entirely.\nShe did all the dirty work for him; and someone has said—was\nit Kipling or Bernard Shaw?—that the female of the species\nis more deadly than the male. Well, it certainly happened in\nthat respect.”\n“Did Wilson ever tell you how you were to regard her?”\n“He wrote to me once in a letter that she was his eyes, his\nears, and his mouth; and she has told me with her own lips\nthat what she said was absolutely the same as ‘The Brother’\nsaid, and that her orders were his orders.”\nMary explained that it was under Z’s orders that she was\nmoved to Valdes Island. She described the wretched condi-\ntions on the island and told of the brutal labour imposed\nupon her and the other colonists:\n“I don’t believe it is possible to conceive of any human\nbeing forcing people to work the way those people did us;\nand I cannot imagine people being such infernal fools as we\nall were; but that is the truth, and nothing but the truth.”\nJustice Morrison asked why the colonists didn’t go to the\nauthorities for help. Mary explained that they were under\nWilson’s mental domination and that he’d deliberately\n\n332 B R O T H E R X I I\ncultivated an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and mistrust:\n“He has separated husband from wife. He vilified each\nfriend to the other friend. He made me do the work I did\nwithout rhyme or reason. It is the most iniquitous and dia-\nbolical form and procedure that has ever taken place.\n“I don’t believe there has been a penal colony in the world,\nno penitentiary, no slave colony that was ever operated under\nmore horrible conditions than this place over there was op-\nerated—and besides that, there was this thing hanging over\npeople about their souls.”\nMary explained to the Chief Justice that she was also\nclaiming personal damages of $10,000\n, although “the damage\nto my physical body is something that cannot be paid for.”\nHarrison called witness after witness, who all corroborated\nMary’s testimony. Many said that she had understated, rather\nthan exaggerated, her case.\n“The story that she has told of the loads she carried and\nof the way in which she toiled has been minimized by her,”\nLeona Painter declared. “She slaved!”\nFrank Cunliffe, counsel for the defendants, astonished the\nmagistrate by submitting no defence.\n“There is no defence?”\n“I have no witnesses,” replied Cunliffe.\nJustice Morrison awarded Mary her claim in full of $26,500,\nownership of the DeCourcy group of islands, four hundred\nacres on Valdes Island, and special damages of $10,000.\nThe following day, Alfred Barley’s case was heard, and even\nmore secrets of the cult were aired before the curious specta-\ntors who packed the courtroom. Roger Painter, the long-haired\nformer “poultry king” of Florida, gave the most sensational\ntestimony of the trial when he described how Brother XII had\ntried to kill his enemies with black magic.\n“It would be impossible to tell the story of such a hell on\nearth,” Painter testified. “I was under terrific tension day and\nnight. I didn’t know what might happen, even into the possi-\nbility of losing my own life.\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 333\n“The whole island, as I can look back through it all now,\nthe whole scheme was to drive you into intense fear and con-\nfusion, so that you were glad to go and leave your money and\ngoods behind, regardless of what it might cost you. That was\nthe operation. . . We understood that we had to surrender ev-\nerything. We believed in it. We did it.”\nPainter then related details of the occult procedure that\nBrother XII had used against his enemies:\n“Now, in a particular case, the most tremendous mental\ndomination that I have ever seen exhibited by any man, or any\ngroup of people, was by that man. He mentally endeavoured\nto control the mentality, the soul of everybody that came near\nhim. If you raised one little finger, one thing in opposition,\nimplacable hatred was given to you from that time on; and if\nneed be, he would even put into operation what I call etheric\nwork, working on the mind and body of a man. He even mur-\ndered him.”\nMr. Harrison: “Have you any example that you can give of\nhis trying to murder people by that mental process?”\n“I certainly have.”\n“Can you mention the names?”\n“I can mention plenty of names. I got a letter from him while\nhe was in England, requesting me to go to work immediately\non Mr. Pooley, the Attorney-General of British Columbia.”\n“In what way?” asked Mr. Harrison.\n“To sever his etheric body from his physical body, that he\nmight die.”\n“Any other persons?”\n“E.A. Lucas, attorney in Vancouver, and Mr. Hinchliffe. Now,\nI don’t know Mr. Hinchliffe’s particular position in the govern-\nment at Victoria, but I know that in this letter he said that he\nhad opposed him in his request on the marriage relationship;\nand he was very bitter and said it was needful that he should be\nremoved. And then there was Maurice Von Platen and Alice\nVon Platen, whom he instructed me to proceed against in an\nendeavour to sever them from their physical bodies.”\n\n334 B R O T H E R X I I\n“Would it be acceptable to construe it as physical force\nagainst these people?” asked Chief Justice Morrison.\n“Not physical force; he didn’t use that word.”\n“If I were to pick up that letter and read it, would it be a fan-\ntastic construction for me to say that I was to go and kill that\nperson? Have you got any of those?”\nPainter replied that he didn’t have the letter: Brother XII\nhad instructed him to return it, and Painter had mailed it back\nto him in Panama.\n“You cannot recall the substance can you, or any of the\nphrases?” asked Harrison.\n“No, not particularly. The letter as a general thing is clear\nin my mind, but I couldn’t repeat the exact language; and he\nmade this remark in the latter part of the letter: he said, ‘Now,\nAbner, old scout, go to work and have me a scalp by the time\nI arrive home.’”\nPainter then proceeded to describe an assassination at-\ntempt which he’d witnessed upon Brother XII’s return:\n“Now then in arcanum work, people sit in a circle, or a tri-\nangle, or in whatever shape they may elect to sit in. I found\nthat all his work was towards, what we term in occult parlance,\nblack magic of a most devilish kind. I side-tracked that work.\nHe couldn’t touch the one that he tried to injure because I\nside-tracked it. He even kept up this arcanum at twelve o’clock\nat night, and I have heard people say they did not believe in\nthese things, but generally, if one will have a little intelligence\nand dig deeply, they will find that much wickedness has been\ncommitted by such things.”\n“Were you present at any of this?” Justice Morrison asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Describe what you saw.”\n“You have an arcanum when there are three in the opera-\ntion. There is the defendant sitting in one position, and Zura\nde Valdes sitting in another position, and myself sitting in an-\nother position. Now, we make certain statements to invoke\ncertain powers—invisible, of course, your lordship—and the\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 335\ncommission—whatever you want to establish, or work to be\ndone in the etheric or mental realm—was done by the one\nthat laid down the arca, and that was invariably Wilson. Oh, it\nwould take months to relate all the things!”\n“What did he say?”\n“Well, for instance, he would stand a man up there in his\nimagination, someone that he hated, that he had this impla-\ncable hatred for. Like, I’m telling you that he stood up there\none that is known locally in this town, and that is George\nHobart, residing at the present time at Cedar-by-the-Sea.”\n“What did he say?”\n“He would stand him up there in the center in his imagina-\ntion, and he would then begin his tirade, cursing and damning\nthat spirit, and then going down this way with his hand, and\nthat way, cutting what they call the etheric, which is the finer\nbody, from which the physical gets its life. The operation was\nsupposed to—that is, the physical organism, as I understood it\nfrom him, the physical organism would gradually become de-\npleted and die.”\nPainter accompanied his testimony with a vivid demon-\nstration of this process of mental murder, slashing the air with\nvertical and horizontal strokes of his hands as he showed how\nBrother XII would quarter the torso of his intended victim.\nAt the end of the two hour hearing, Chief Justice Morrison\nawarded Alfred Barley his claim in full of $14,232; he later de-\nclared that the two cases he’d heard against Brother XII were\n“the strangest cases ever to come before a Canadian court of\nlaw.”\nr r r\nMary Connally and Alfred Barley had won their court battle,\nbut how they would realize their claims was a mystery. Brother\nXII and Madame Z had fled DeCourcy Island and their where-\nabouts were unknown. Shortly before the court cases, however,\nthey’d vented their rage by making a raid on the colony and\n\n336 B R O T H E R X I I\nvandalizing the premises.\nAt the farm, houses had been pillaged and wrecked. Win-\ndows were broken, doors removed or torn from their hinges,\nand crockery smashed against the walls. The water-tanks had\nbeen punctured by bullet holes, fruit trees were uprooted,\nand the farm-equipment was either missing or damaged\nbeyond repair. In the schoolhouse, desks had been hurled out\nthrough the windows with such force that their cast-iron fit-\ntings had broken on the ground. One of the cabins had even\nbeen crushed by a huge tree felled deliberately onto its roof.\nAt the Point, houses had been hacked and ripped, their\ndoors, windows and cupboards removed or smashed. In one\nhouse, a kitchen cabinet had been torn off the wall and delib-\nerately burnt in the yard outside. Brother XII’s own house\nhadn’t been spared. He’d gone through it with an axe in a\ndestructive frenzy. His collection of model ships lay splintered\non the floor, mingling with the shattered glass and broken\nframes of water-colours and etchings. In his study, books had\nbeen spilled from the shelves, papers were strewn everywhere,\nand the floor was littered with debris. There were huge gashes\nin the polished wood of his writing desk.\nIn the lagoon, the \nLady Royal had been scuttled with a\ncharge of dynamite. She lay on her side in the shallow waters, a\nhole blown in her hull just above the keel. Another explosion\nhad shattered her mast, and her skylight and deck lights had\nbeen smashed with an axe. The beautiful sailboat Brother XII\nhad loved was now a battered hulk abandoned on the beach.\nAlfred Barley inspected the premises, making careful note\nof the damage. He discovered some evidence of Wilson’s pos-\nsible use of drugs. In a cabin formerly occupied by him, Barley\nfound a metal box that contained needles for a hypodermic\nsyringe. He also discovered some Trinitrin tablets, some med-\nicine from Steadman’s that Wilson took for his heart, and a\nsmall bottle of an unknown drug, labelled in Wilson’s hand-\nwriting, “Ignatia, Z.” Barley reasoned that the vandalism had\nbeen carried out only days earlier: a piece of Sunlight soap in\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 337\na soap-tray, although dry on top, still had a few drops of water\nclinging to the underside.\nAlexandrine Gibb of \nThe Toronto Star was one of the\nreporters who talked to the disciples. She interviewed them in\nthe Center Building, where she saw signs of Mary Connally’s\nformer life—a Persian carpet, a beautiful black and gold shawl,\nand a piano. The Asheville socialite was wearing a tweed skirt,\ntorn stockings and muddy shoes when she spoke to Gibb. Her\nhands were roughened by hard work, her nails discoloured\nand broken.\n“I cannot tell you what agony I suffered,” she told the re-\nporter. “I was abused, threatened, made to scrub floors, carry\nheavy loads, and I expected at any time to get shot in the back.\nBrother XII turned from a saint into a devil. He forced me to\ntill the land, and he made the rest of the colony stand over me\nand make me work.”\n“Yes!” Painter broke in. “Her that used to have fifteen bath-\nrooms in her own home!”\nPainter had been plowing a muddy field when Gibb ar-\nrived. Rising up in all his filthy majesty, his eyes glittering with\na weird light, he brandished his fist in the air and shouted, “He\nwas the focal point of all evil! I am the focal point of good! I\nfought his evil powers!”\n“You didn’t have to stay with Brother XII,” countered\nGibb.\n“We dared not leave. He would shoot us in the back. He\ndrove the women into the fields and made them work from\ntwo o’clock in the morning until midnight. He made us be-\nlieve that we must distrust each other. We were all warned to\nbeware of the others. The entire colony seethed with fear, dis-\ntrust, and black magic. Besides, he had the boats—we were\nmarooned on the island.”\n“What do you mean by black magic?” asked Gibb.\n“He would control our bodies. He forced us by his will\npower. The women were forced to carry big loads through the\nforests on the islands. They were taken from one island to an-\n\n338 B R O T H E R X I I\nother and left there alone at night. He drove us onwards with\ncurses and foul language. We were slaves in reality.”\n“But why did you submit to his slave-driving methods?”\nasked Gibb.\n“Just a test put on us by Satan himself. Those who survived it\nare here. The many who couldn’t stand it have left. In the past\nfour years, more than two hundred people have come and\ngone. They were not fitted to enter the Gateway of Truth.”\nr r r\nIn October 1932, six months before the court cases, Brother\nXII and Madame Z left DeCourcy Island. They travelled di-\nrectly across the Strait of Georgia to Roberts Creek on the\nSechelt Peninsula, about twenty-five miles north of Vancouver.\nAgate, who had been working as a real estate agent for the\nfirm of Lowen, Morfitt and Harvey, bought property for them\nthree miles north of the Union Steamship landing, registering\nit in the name of Harold Krause. Here, in a clearing in the\nbush several hundred yards from the waterfront, Brother XII\nand Madame Z went into hiding.\nAgate and Harold Krause hauled supplies to the site in the\nKhuenaten, and Krause built a comfortable cabin on the prop-\nerty for the pair. He also built a secret room in the hollow\nstump of a giant cedar tree, where the couple could retreat\nif necessary. The room had wooden ledges for sleeping, and\nthere was even a tiny compartment hidden behind a sliding\npanel in the rear wall, where they could further conceal them-\nselves further. According to one account, Brother XII stored\nhis gold at Roberts Creek under a sail taken from the Lady\nRoyal.\nAn enormous quantity of supplies had been left behind\nat the colony when Brother XII and Madame Z decamped.\nThese included vast reserves of flour, sugar, meat and feed that\nhad been shipped by boxcar to the colonists at Chemainus,\nlumber and other building materials, coffee, tea, baby food,\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 339\nmatches, blankets, four thousand jars of home preserves that\nthe women of the colony had worked night and day to put up,\nand enough clothing to last for ten years.\nBrother XII instructed Agate to sell everything to Bill Coats,\nwho lived on nearby Gabriola Island. Coats bought the goods\n“for a song,” as Roger Painter put it, and worked twenty hours\na day for weeks transporting his haul to Gabriola. Coats’s wind-\nfall included Brother XII’s complete set of British Admiralty\ncharts of the world—a stack that sat eighteen inches high and\nweighed over two hundred pounds—and the colony’s arsenal\nof guns and ammunition. He later opened a store with his bo-\nnanza, making a comfortable living for years after selling off\nsupplies that had been stockpiled for Armageddon.\nAgate, who was wanted by the police as a suspect in the\nvandalism of the settlement, was now using the name “John\nMurray.” He was Brother XII’s link with the outside world,\npicking up his mail from P.O. Box 1177 in Vancouver and\nrunning errands for him in the \nKhuenaten. Agate occasion-\nally visited his younger brother in Vancouver, Percy Mansfield\nAgate.\n“Edric was a queer one,” Percy recalls. “He had queer ideas,\nbut he was a brain, alright. He didn’t say much about this\nBrother XII business—just that he thought he was a brilliant\nman.”\nAgate dated his brother’s sister-in-law, a girl named Ruth\nJohnstone. She recalls that they drank together in several\nWest End hotels, took walks in Stanley Park, and occasionally\ntoured the harbour in the tug. Agate was a fine pianist, liked\nto read \nWeird Tales, and joked that Ruth was born under a fire\nsign. “He was a loner,” she says. “He never told you where he\nwas going or what he was doing. He used to say, ‘Don’t be sur-\nprised, Ruth, if one of these days I’m gone.’”\nBrother XII and Madame Z left Roberts Creek in April\n1933, shortly before the court cases in Nanaimo. In Victoria,\na bellhop at the Empress Hotel reported that the two were\nregistered there during the trial and that they’d even had the\n\n340 B R O T H E R X I I\nlatest editions of the newspaper delivered to their room, so\nthey could follow the progress of the cases. By the time the\npolice checked out the story, the pair had vanished.\nAfter leaving Victoria, Brother XII and Z cruised north\nin the Khuenaten, hiding out in secluded coves and inlets\nas they worked their way up the coast. In Seymour Narrows,\nthey picked up their mail at O’Brien Bay, then cruised north\ninto Discovery Passage. At Sonora Island, thirty miles north\nof Campbell River, they encountered a British Columbia\nProvincial policeman, who wished the unlikely-looking tour-\nists “good fishing” before moving on to more pressing duties.\nHe apparently hadn’t read the newspapers.\nLeaving the northern tip of Vancouver Island behind,\nBrother XII and Madame Z followed the Inside Passage to\nPrince Rupert, western terminus of the Canadian National\nRailway. Here they either sold or scuttled the \nKhuenaten\nand boarded the train for Montreal. With the gold stashed\nin steamer trunks, one can imagine them settling into their\nberth for their journey east. It had been an easy, almost lei-\nsurely escape.\nEdric Douglas Agate was waiting for them in Montreal. Like\nAgate, Brother XII was now travelling under a false name:\nhe’d assumed the initials and surname of Mabel’s first hus-\nband, John Coulson Skottowe, to become “Julian Churton\nSkottowe.” From Montreal, the three fugitives booked passage\nfor England.\nr r r\nThree months after the court cases in British Columbia,\nBrother XII was living quietly and anonymously in a small\nfarmhouse called Cowley Lodge, near the village of Kentisbury\nin northern Devonshire. On July 31, 1933, he made a new will\nunder his assumed name of Julian Churton Skottowe, leaving\neverything to Mabel Skottowe. The will was witnessed by a\nshoe retailer from Fremington named Charles Patterson, and\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 341\nby Agate, who signed as “James A. Murray, Gentleman.”\nBrother XII remained at Cowley Lodge for another year.\nOn August 10, 1934, he was issued a new passport in London.\nHe and Mabel left almost immediately for the continent.\nTheir destination was Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and the trip was\nurgent—possibly a matter of life and death.\nSwiss records show that Edward Arthur Wilson and Mabel\nSkottowe arrived in Neuchâtel on August 24, 1934. An elegant,\nprosperous town with a population of twenty-five thousand,\nNeuchâtel had a distinctly medieval charm, with fountains,\npicturesque streets and many fine patrician houses built of\nyellow sandstone. Alexandre Dumas once wrote that the town\nlooked as if it were carved out of butter. Across the placid\nwaters of Lake Neuchâtel, there was a breathtaking view of\nthe entire middle range of the Alps, from Mont Blanc to\nthe Bernese Oberland. The two new arrivals were met by Dr.\nRoger Auguste Schmidt. Born in nearby Thielle-Wavre and a\ngraduate of the University of Geneva, Schmidt and his family\nhad spent a year at the colony in British Columbia before re-\nturning to Neuchâtel on June 15, 1933. Since Schmidt had\nbeen Wilson’s personal physician, it seems likely that Wilson\nhad come to Neuchâtel to seek medical aid.\nDr. Schmidt was working at the Clinique du Chanet, a pri-\nvate medical clinic located at 1 Route de la Chanet, on a hill\noverlooking Neuchâtel. The clinic specialized in the treatment\nof tuberculosis and its patients came from all over Europe.\nThe four-storey building had tall windows which opened onto\nbalconies, so that patients could be wheeled outside to inhale\nthe invigorating mountain air. For at least part of his sojourn\nin Neuchâtel, Wilson was a patient here, although not for tu-\nberculosis, under the care of Dr. Schmidt.\nDuring the same period, Wilson rented an apartment at\n19, Rue des Beaux-Arts, a handsome building in the center of\nNeuchâtel, close to the lake and to the University of Neuchâtel.\nOnly two blocks away was the Musée des Beaux-Arts, with its\nfamous eighteenth-century clockwork dolls of Pierre Jaquet-\n\n342 B R O T H E R X I I\nDroz, which had fascinated European royalty. Nearby in the\nMuseum of Ethnology, Wilson probably took the opportunity\nto examine its fine collection of Egyptian antiquities. Or per-\nhaps, from the Quai Osterwald, he contemplated the tranquil\nwaters of the lake and the majestic panorama of mountains in\nthe distance.\nWilson’s enjoyment of the pleasures of Neuchâtel lasted only\na few short months. With the setting sun crowning the summit\nof the Alps with gold, he died in his apartment in the Rue\ndes Beaux-Arts at nine o’clock on the evening of November 7,\n1934. The death certificate, which was signed by Dr. Schmidt,\nprovides few clues to his last days. Schmidt indicated the\ncause of death according to the International Classification of\nCauses of Death as: “XIV. 148 a,” which means \nsclerosis of the\ncoronary arteries = angina pectoris. Wilson was fifty-six years old.\nThe death certificate lists him as \ncelibataire—single.\nOn November 11, Wilson’s body was cremated at the\nCimetière de Beauregard, and his ashes sent to his family in\nEngland—probably to his mother in Bournemouth, who died\nthree months later on February 14, 1935 (Wilson’s father had\ndied six years earlier). The Swiss authorities have no record\ntoday of the identity of the individual to whom the ashes were\nsent.\nOn November 14, a one-line notice of Wilson’s death ap-\npeared in \nFeuille d’avis de Neuchâtel. His Swiss identity card\nwas stamped “DÉCÉDÉ.” Mabel Skottowe apparently left\nNeuchâtel soon afterwards, since her identity card reads,\n“The certificate of nationality was returned to the D.P.N.\n[Departement de Police de Neuchâtel] on March 2, 1935, be-\ncause she left in November, 1934.” Of Brother XII’s treasure,\nforty-three boxes of gold coins weighing an estimated half a\nton, there was no trace.\nThe lack of detailed information about Wilson’s death has\nled to a great deal of speculation about the circumstances sur-\nrounding it. Some writers have portrayed Mabel Skottowe as\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 343\nkeeping a stone-faced vigil by the bed, waiting for the sallow,\nsunken figure of Wilson to die. They have even suggested that\nshe may have helped him on his way with a discreetly admin-\nistered dose of poison. Did Mabel have access to a certain\nnumbered Swiss bank account? Upon his death, did she qui-\netly take possession of the $400,000 \nthat he had accumulated\nduring his seven-year reign as Brother XII? And did she then\nstep out into the streets of Neuchâtel, ending her liaison with\nthe man with whom she had shared so much?\nEdric Douglas Agate, who may have been able to provide\nthe answers to such questions, arrived at his parents’ home in\nWallington, North London, shortly after Wilson’s death. He\ntold his family that he thought that war with Germany was in-\nevitable, and that he didn’t want to be involved in it because\nhe didn’t wish to take life in any way. He then packed up a\nlarge quantity of his mother’s china, saucepans, blankets and\nother household goods. Agate loaded everything into several\nlarge steamer trunks, plastered labels all over them and set off\nfor America.\nMonths passed and his parents heard nothing more from\nhim. Finally a letter arrived from southern Oregon. Edric\nwrote that he was living in a remote area, high up in a pine\nforest. He’d built himself a log cabin, and was growing vege-\ntables and keeping some chickens. When he needed money,\nhe cut down a tree and sold it in the town below. Edric’s father\nwas angry at his son for the kind of life he’d chosen, and tore\nup the letter. That was the last that was ever heard of Edric\nDouglas Agate.\nMabel Skottowe was seen on only a few occasions over the\nyears. Sometime in the late 1930s, she was recognized in the\nlobby of a luxury hotel in Zurich by a woman from Nanaimo,\nthen living in Europe. She was also seen on the street in\nMontreal one time. Alice Rudy reports that Mabel lived in\nSeattle for awhile, where she tried without success to start a\ngroup of her own, based upon Brother XII’s teachings.\nMabel was seen for the last time in Nanaimo in the 1940s. A\n\n344 B R O T H E R X I I\nformer workman at the colony was walking along Front Street\nwhen he noticed a late model black sedan pull up to the curb.\nA haughty-looking woman in furs stepped out. He was amazed\nto recognize Madame Z. He went up to her and asked what had\nbrought her back to Nanaimo. \n“Morbid curiosity,” she replied;\nshe then stepped back into the car and was driven away.\nr r r\nThe news of Brother XII’s death in Switzerland did not\nreach the disciples at Cedar until several years later. On Sep-\ntember 3, 1938, Mary Connally wrote to Alfred Barley that she\nhad received information that Wilson had died some time ago,\nand that it might be possible to recover something from his\nestate on the basis of the judgments which were given against\nhim in their favour.\nBarley was initially dubious. “We have heard many rumours\nabout E.A.W. from time to time,” he replied, “that he is here,\nthere, or somewhere else, and hitherto I must say I have not\nbeen inclined to consider seriously any of them. You do not\nsay what the source of your information is, but can you be cer-\ntain it is not just another of these rumours?”\nMary wrote back that Wilson’s death had been confirmed,\nand that Frank Cunliffe, in conjunction with the London firm\nof Craigen, Hicks and Company, was making a claim for her\nagainst his estate, which consisted of an unclaimed inheri-\ntance from his parents of 2,156 pounds, 3 shillings, and 11\npence. Barley agreed to join forces with Mary in order to fi-\nnance a claim against the estate.\nWilson’s creditors included Mary Connally, who filed a\nclaim for £8,250; Alfred Barley, who filed for £1,600; Dr. Roger\nSchmidt, who filed for £140 \nfor medical services rendered;\nand Margery Wilson, his first wife, who filed a claim from\nAuckland, New Zealand, for £720, arrears of payment under a\nseparation deed. Since Wilson’s estate was insufficient to pay\nhis debts, his creditors only expected to receive payments pro-\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 345\nportional to their respective claims.\nThe hearing opened in London at the Royal Courts of\nJustice in the Strand on October 13, 1939. It was delayed by\nthe outbreak of World War II, and eventually adjourned \nsine\ndie. In the spring of 1943, it was re-opened. After dragging on\nfor another three years, the claims were finally settled by the\nChancery Court on October 2, 1946. By that time, legal costs\nhad consumed most of the value of the estate and the pay-\nments to the claimants were nominal.\nBrother XII was dead, yet several people close to the story,\nbesides Alfred Barley, had difficulty believing it. Bruce\nMcKelvie, for one, held that “a man who was so false in life\ncould not be depended upon in death.” In a talk he gave in\n1953, McKelvie stated: “The death report may be true, but it\nis quite possible that he is still alive.” Even Victor B. Harrison,\nthe lawyer who acted for Barley in making his claim against\nthe estate, declared: “It is just expedient for him to be consid-\nered dead.”\nCould Wilson have faked his death in collusion with Dr.\nSchmidt? In many courts of law, a death certificate is not con-\nsidered \nprima facie evidence of death. Death must still be\nproved by corroborative means. If Schmidt were devoted to\nWilson, he could easily have signed the death certificate, while\nthe body that was cremated could have been the corpse of a\npatient in the Clinique du Chanet who had died at the same\ntime.\nThere are a number of reports of Wilson being sighted after\nNovember 7, 1934, the official date of his death. The most per-\nsuasive and intriguing is that of the late Donald M. Cunliffe,\nthe son of Frank Cunliffe and himself a lawyer. The events he\nwitnessed took place when he was a boy of twelve, but always\nremained vividly in his memory. He writes:\nIn the latter part of June 1936\n, as our family was preparing\nto move to our summer home at Qualicum Beach, my father\nreceived a telephone call, as a result of which he told us that\n\n346 B R O T H E R X I I\nour departure would be delayed for two or three hours. Our\ncar was partially packed, and he invited me to accompany\nhim to the home in Cedar of “Lady Mary” Connally.\nI was given a jigsaw puzzle to work on, while my father\nand “Lady Mary” discussed their business with some\ndegree of urgency. I remember hearing reference to “The\nBrother,” discussion of boat schedules, and references to\nSan Francisco. Near the end of this discussion, which lasted\nfor about one hour, my father stood up, and in closing his\nbriefcase, said words to the effect that, “There seems to be\nnothing left but for me to try to meet him in San Francisco,\nand it might be better if I took my family along.” At this\npoint, I was most attentive and heard “Lady Mary” say, “I\nam not sure that he would be willing to see you there,”\nwhereupon my father replied, “We will just have to take our\nchances.” In the car on the way home, my father told me\nthat I was not to mention anything of this to my mother or\nto my sister until he said so.\nAbout a week later, Frank Cunliffe announced to the family\nthat they would be driving to San Francisco for a two week hol-\niday. Donald Cunliffe resumes his account:\nWhen we arrived in San Francisco, we checked in at\neither the St. Francis or the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. My\nfather made a number of telephone calls to attorneys in\nSan Francisco and to one shipping line, inquiring as to the\nwhereabouts of a ship, the name of which I have forgotten.\nThe following day, I was given the option of going shopping\nwith my mother and sister, or accompanying my father on\ncertain business calls. There was no question that I would\nhave nothing to do with the shopping trip, so I went with\nmy father to a bank building and sat in a waiting room for\nabout half an hour, while he talked to a lawyer in the bank\nbuilding. Following that, we went to another bank with the\nlawyer and withdrew what to me appeared to be a sizeable\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 347\namount of cash. This was placed in a bag and then placed\nin the other lawyer’s brief case. Following that, my father\nmade another telephone call which I could not hear, and\nwe went to lunch together. Following lunch, we went to\nthe docks and boarded a liner. I was put in the charge of a\nseaman or officer, and was shown around the ship, while my\nfather vanished into the bowels of the same ship. My tour\nhaving been completed, I waited at the head of the gang-\nway and eventually my father re-appeared, without the brief\ncase, with a man I can best describe as being quite pale, who\nwas dressed in white and had a white wide-brimmed hat. I\nwas particularly struck by his eyes, although I cannot recall\nwhy. There was no shaking of hands as my father and the\nman parted. He spoke only once, which was, “I shan’t see\nyou again, Cunliffe, but I may be in touch.” My father said\nnothing, but looked extremely grim.\nI was naturally very curious about this transaction, and\nasked my father who the man was, whether he was Brother\nXII, and my father said that he was not permitted to say, but\nthat he hoped he never had to deal with a man like him\nagain.\nThat appeared to be the end of the incident, for I took it\nmore or less instinctively that my father wanted no further\ndiscussion of the matter.\nWhen asked to describe the man on board the ship in more\ndetail, Donald Cunliffe recalled: “There was an impression\nof whiteness about him. His hat was white—his clothes were\nwhite—his shoes were white. Everything about him was white.\nAnd these gleaming eyes! This man \nlived! He was vibrant! I\nmet Churchill once—a totally dissimilar person—but the\nsame kind of electric energy seemed to flow through him.”\nA year later, the same man made contact with Frank Cunliffe\nagain. Donald Cunliffe relates:\nIn July of 1937, I was at home on a Saturday morning,\n\n348 B R O T H E R X I I\npreparing for a trip to Smithers, B.C., for a visit to my uncle\nand cousins. My father was not yet home from the office,\nand my mother and sister and the maid were at Qualicum\nBeach at the summer home. The telephone rang, and it\nwas a long distance call for my father. I informed the op-\nerator that he was not yet home, but was expected shortly.\nThe operator, while the line was still open, addressed the\ncalling party as a “Mr. Wilson,” and wished to know whether\nhe would call again, or whether my father should place the\ncall on his arrival at the house. After some humming and\nhawing, the male voice instructed the operator to have my\nfather call the Trans-Atlantic operator in Gibraltar. About\nfive minutes later, my father arrived home and I passed on\nthe message to him. He appeared to be quite surprised, but\nsent me from the room and as I left, I heard him calling\nlong distance. Shortly thereafter, I returned to the room\nand found my father sitting in his chair with a perplexed\nlook on his face. I asked if that was the same man I had seen\nthe year before at San Francisco, and my father said, “Yes,”\nand (something which was most unusual for him to say), “I\nhope he goes to hell!”\nLater on that afternoon, I went back to my father’s office\nwith him and he showed me the corporate seal of the\nAquarian Foundation, and said when he died to keep this,\nbecause some day it would become a matter of history.\nDonald Cunliffe’s fascinating account certainly suggests\nthat Brother XII may have fabricated his death in Switzerland\nin 1934. If so, he wouldn’t have been the first person to suc-\ncessfully accomplish this subterfuge. In the absence of further\ninformation, his death remains another elusive piece in the\nmysterious puzzle of his life.\nr r r\nIn spite of their intention to continue the Work, the former\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 349\ndisciples of Brother XII didn’t remain together at Cedar. Over\ntime, the group dispersed. The Crawfords were the first to go,\nreturning to Florida soon after the court cases. “Hereafter, I’m\nnot taking orders from no one,” Bruce Crawford declared.\n“I’m just gonna listen to my Higher Self.”\nBill and Mary Lowell were the next to leave. In September\n1935, they loaded up a trailer and drove to Oceano, California,\naccompanied by Sarah Puckett. In a farewell note to friends at\nCedar, Sarah wrote: “We kept the faith, we did our duty, we fin-\nished our task. We have been released from ‘old obligations’\nand are now free to bid farewell.”\nIn the fall of 1937, Roger Painter, the Barleys, and Kaye\nKirchner moved to Marysville, Washington, north of Seattle,\nwhere they started a berry farm. During a long walk through\nthe berry canes, Painter tried to persuade a newlywed couple\nwho were visiting the farm to join the community, telling them\nthat by using the knowledge he possessed they could have a\nchild who would become the next Christ.\nAlfred Barley strained his heart in the hot springs outside\nPortland, Oregon, and died on May 14, 1940, at the age of\nsixty-eight. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in\nhis favourite grove of trees, which his friends always referred\nto afterwards as “Alfred’s grove.”\nRoger Painter died on August 13, 1950\n, at the age of sev-\nenty, also from a heart attack. After his death, his wife Rachel\nwent to the police and told them Painter had hypnotized\nher before he died and was controlling her from beyond\nthe grave. She was committed to a mental hospital in Sedro\nWooley, Washington.\nAnnie Barley moved to Halcyon, California, where she lived\nlike a pauper, alone in a single room. Her books provided\nsolace, but there were times, she said, when she was so lonely\nshe even welcomed visits from people she didn’t like. Annie\ncollapsed and died on May 22, 1955, at the age of eighty-five,\nwhile baking bread.\nMary Connally remained in British Columbia after the\n\n350 B R O T H E R X I I\nothers left, moving to DeCourcy Island, where she lived with\nher secretary, Margaret Whyte. When Margaret left, Mary\nstayed alone on the island, hoisting a white tablecloth up a\nflagpole every morning so that her friends across the channel\nwould know she was all right. She never found it in her heart\nto condemn Brother XII, and before she returned to North\nCarolina, she told Victor B. Harrison: “For the old Brother, I’d\ngive that much money again, if I had it to give.” Mary died on\nOctober 20, 1947, at the age of seventy-six, in the Blue Gables\nnursing home in Asheville, North Carolina.\nSpurred on by persistent rumours that Brother XII’s gold\nstill remained on the islands, treasure seekers over the years\nransacked and dismantled the colonists’ cabins, dynamited\nthe wells, and dug all over Valdes and DeCourcy Islands. But\nto this day, no one has yet announced the discovery of Brother\nXII’s treasure.\nOne unusual find was made quite by accident. Sam Greenall,\nMary Connally’s caretaker on DeCourcy Island, was keeping\nchickens in one of the colony’s outbuildings. Every time he\nwent inside the chicken house, he bumped his head—for\nsome reason, the floor was built too high. He decided to lower\nit. When he ripped it up, he discovered a trapdoor. Certain\nhe’d stumbled on the gold’s hiding place, he excitedly pried\nup the door and peered into the gloom. Seeing a bundle,\nhe eagerly reached down to examine it more closely. It was a\nloose roll of tarpaper. Lifting it out of the vault, Greenall un-\nfurled it and read the inscription. Scrawled in chalk on the\ndark surface was a final message from Brother XII, an angry\nshout from the past: \n“For fools and traitors—nothing!”\nr r r\nWhat became of the original seven Governors of the\nAquarian Foundation? Although they were each affected in\ndifferent ways by Brother XII, there’s little doubt he left his\nmark on the lives of all of them.\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 351\nWill Levington Comfort felt responsible for leading so many\nastray with his initial endorsement of Brother XII. His last two\nnovels, \nApache and The Pilot Comes Aboard, were praised by\ncritics, but failed to achieve the commercial success for which\nhe’d hoped. Comfort died in Los Angeles on November 2,\n1932, at the age of fifty-four, of complications arising from\nacute alcoholism—a death, it was said, hastened by his disillu-\nsionment over his experience with Brother XII.\nCoulson Turnbull’s association with Brother XII damaged\nhis reputation as an astrologer. He never went back to Santa\nCruz, but remained in Vancouver, where he continued to prac-\ntise astrology. The strain of his involvement with Brother XII,\nincluding his collapse in court in 1928, left him, in many re-\nspects, a broken man. He died in Vancouver on July 30, 1935,\nat the age of seventy.\nMaurice Von Platen returned to Pasadena, but continued\nto spend summers at Cedar. He rarely discussed Brother XII,\nbut in a small booklet he published in 1934, \nA Modern Pilgrim’s\nProgress, he makes a veiled reference to him in the chapter\n“Vampires I have Known,” in which he warns readers that “the\nmost dangerous of all vampires is that person who knows the\noccult side of the Universal Law. Through his knowledge,\nhe deliberately draws upon the life force of the persons who\ndo not know how to protect themselves against his attempts.\nThe result of this may even be DEATH.” Von Platen died in\nPasadena on January 17, 1938, at the age of seventy-eight.\nJoseph Benner started his own organization after breaking\naway from Brother XII. In 1932, he published the monthly\nlessons he wrote for his students as a book, \nThe Way to the\nKingdom. Despite financial hardships, Benner struggled on for\nmany years, believing there was a real need for his teachings.\nHe died in Akron, Ohio, on September 24, 1938, at the age of\nsixty-six. In a strange sequel to his death, Benner’s metaphys-\nical classic \nThe Impersonal Life was discovered in the 1960s by\nElvis Presley, who eagerly embraced its philosophy and gave\naway hundreds of copies to people he met—an unexpected\n\n352 B R O T H E R X I I\nconnection between Brother XII’s disciple and the King of\nRock ‘n’ Roll.\nEdward Lucas continued to practise law in Vancouver. He\noften joked about his time with Brother XII, remembering\nhim with affection. Lucas remained a Theosophist, but one\nwith his own unique interpretation of the philosophy. He be-\nlieved, for instance, that the Masters of Wisdom would never\nallow the atom to be split. Lucas sold a screenplay to Twentieth\nCentury-Fox for a Janet Gaynor film, but the movie was never\nmade. An expert on the Civil War, he appeared in 1957 on the\ntelevision quiz program “The $64,000 Question.” He won his\nround, but the show was cancelled before he could return.\nLucas died in Vancouver on December 14, 1961, at the age of\nseventy-eight.\nPhillip Fisher, who had a nervous breakdown in 1928, never\nfully recovered his mental health, continuing to suffer from\nparanoia and delusions of grandeur. He became obsessed\nwith the idea of conspiracies to the extent that he believed the\ncartoon figures on the cover of the British magazine Punch\ncontained clues to the existence of an international plot to\ntake over the world. Fisher formed a society to research the\nconspiracy and renamed his house at Boat Harbour “The\nPunch Bowl.” In 1954, he tried to found a “City of Light,”\nmodelled after the Aquarian Foundation, in the hills behind\nChemainus. In his latter years, Fisher would become ex-\ntremely agitated whenever he talked about Brother XII and\nhad to be hospitalized several times as a result. Fearing that a\nfurther disturbance would kill him, his doctor refused to ever\nlet him be interviewed on the subject. Fisher died in Nanaimo\non March 10, 1979, at the age of eighty-four.\nr r r\nConventional methods of research have yielded a great\ndeal of information about Brother XII. But what insights into\nhis life could an experienced and reputable psychic provide?\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 353\nThe author thought it would be interesting to find out. He\ntherefore decided to consult James H. P. Wilkie, a psychic of\ninternational renown.\nA dark, heavyset man in his late sixties, Wilkie first became\naware of his psychic powers as a boy growing up in the Scottish\nhighlands. He would often see a large brown hand beckoning\nhim to follow it across the moors. Hours later, he would awaken\nfrom an overshadowed state, sitting on some desolate rock\nmiles from home, brooding on half-remembered glimpses\ninto an unseen world. The hand, he later learned, belonged\nto his spirit guide, a four-thousand-year-old Egyptian priest\nnamed Rama, whom he soon began to channel. Trained by\nthe famous Scottish medium Jean Thomson, of Kircaldy, Fife,\nWilkie has lectured widely in North America, spoken at uni-\nversities and foundations, and been consulted by businessmen\nand celebrities. On September 13, 1962, on a Toronto radio\nprogram, he predicted the Cuban missile crisis six weeks\nbefore it occurred. He has also consulted with U.S. astronaut\nEdgar Mitchell, following Mitchell’s ESP experiments in space.\nWilkie’s feats have been chronicled in Allen Spraggett’s book\nThe Unexplained and in his own book The Gift Within.\nWilkie receives visitors in a drawing room richly decorated\nwith his collection of art. Paintings cover the walls, and reli-\ngious icons, woodcarvings, Japanese silkscreens, and marble\nand bronze statuettes crowd together in a bizarre display of\nhis eclectic taste. A statue of an Oriental mandarin stares in-\nscrutably across the room towards the bust of an Egyptian\npharaoh. Wilkie, who had no prior knowledge of Brother XII,\nsat on a Victorian settee surrounded by scarlet cushions. Given\na photograph of Brother XII, he concentrated for a few mo-\nments, then began to speak rapidly as he received impressions\nabout him from his spirit guide, Rama:\n“His name was given to him from the spirit world by his\nguide. It was more his connection with Christ than it was as-\ntrological. I feel as if he knew Christ at one time—or thought\nhe did. He looked upon himself as a previous disciple who’d\n\n354 B R O T H E R X I I\nbecome exalted.\n“In his youth, he was a restless soul. He had terrible depres-\nsions. He was in contact with forces he had to obey; he knew\nhe couldn’t lead a normal life. There was a time when he\nlived alone, completely isolated—he wanted no contact with\na human being. I feel that when he was younger, he was more\npure, more ordained psychically and spiritually.\n“I see him writing in trance-like states. If you could watch\nhim in those moments alone, you’d see his face change com-\npletely as his guide came through. He had visions of the past\nand the future—he received information about Egypt. I am\ngiven the word \nLuxor. That particular site in Egypt was impor-\ntant to him.\n“He was what we would call insane many times. He was defi-\nnitely possessed. He worked with angels—spirits of all kinds,\nsometimes of the lower order. He drew radical, earthbound\nsouls to him. He drew powers of darkness—he was drawing\nevil around him at different times. When you write about\nhim, you are writing about many different personalities in one\nlifetime.\n“Did he ever give himself another name? If he did, I’m not\nsurprised—he changed his name as he evolved. This man\nhad the power to take a person’s life and change it totally. It\nwouldn’t take him long to get followers. Those who believed\nin him still believe in him—the effect he had on them is some-\nthing they will never forget.\n“He wasn’t a normal man: he was a unique, almost freakish\nindividual. Yet he had a great spiritual gift. He was meant to be\na leader and to have a group. That was his destiny. His back-\nground didn’t really shape him—he was born to be a messianic\nfigure of some kind.”\nWilkie was asked to describe Brother XII’s female com-\npanion, Madame Z:\n“She was an eccentric person, a mystical type. She was fas-\ncinated by ritual magic. She had a flair for the theatrical. She\nwas the kind of person to whom witchcraft and black magic\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 355\nappeal deeply.\n“She saw the powers he had, and was attracted to him—he\nappealed to her animal and mystical nature. She saw forces\nin him she could blend with and use. She was more fanatical\nthan evil—she was both good and evil, clever and mixed-up.”\nAsked about Brother XII’s death, Wilkie answered: “His\ndeath came at the right time, karmically. But it wasn’t a\nnormal death. It was planned. It was as if someone finally cor-\nnered him, and then—through either poisoning or physical\nattack—murdered him. I know that someone was doing some-\nthing to him physically. Someone planned his death.”\n“Could it have been Madame Z?”\n“She may have instigated his death through her knowledge\nof either drugs or magic. He might have had a massive heart\nattack, but it wouldn’t appear to be murder. I see her as if she\nwere possessed. She could be an evil person, but he was never\nan evil person.”\n“Is Madame Z still alive?”\n“I am not psychically aware of her death. I’m picking up a\nhot country—somewhere that’s cheap to live, where it’s easy\nto survive. I’m picking up heat—tremendous heat—and a for-\neign language. South America, possibly. She planned to go\nthere. This woman had terrific powers—she could live a long\ntime. But I have the feeling her life is over. She’s in some place\nwhere people look after her—a home or a hospital. She’s\nmentally confused—she may be crippled or insane. It meant\nso much to her to have the power; then she felt empty. Guilt—\nshe felt tremendous guilt.”\n“Did she take Brother XII’s money?”\n“She lost the money—she never had the luxury it could\nhave brought her.”\n“Do any of Brother XII’s papers survive?”\n“She took all of his papers with her after his death. They’re\nin a suitcase somewhere. She keeps it locked. She guards it\nconstantly—she won’t let it out of her sight. It contains all his\nwritings—his journals, his mystical diaries, all of his secrets. \nIf\n\n356 B R O T H E R X I I\nsomeone goes near it, or tries to take it from her, she becomes\nterribly upset—she becomes frantic. It may be that her death\nalone will reveal its contents. Again, I’m picking up that she’s\nconfused. She could be just another alcoholic.”\n“What was the message that Brother XII wanted to bring to\nthe world?”\n“He wanted to be a prophet, a martyr, a messiah. He be-\nlieved that thousands would follow him, that he would play an\nimportant role in history. But his vision became corrupted; he\ncouldn’t live the laws he taught—he wasn’t spiritual enough\nto uphold a true humility. He wanted to control, instead of\nlead. He became a spiritual megalomaniac.\n“It could have been a wonderful mission, but the ego killed\nhim—the selfishness, the greed, the fanaticism—the passion\nto believe that he could become a god on earth. He was self-\ndestructive. He killed himself.”\nWilkie paused, then said something surprising:\n“I feel his presence in the room now. He’s telling me he’s\nadvanced, he’s evolved in the spirit world. He apologizes to\nhis followers and he tries to help the ones he hurt. He thanks\nthose who still believe in him and those who’ve forgiven him.\nEach time someone forgives him, he can go further spiritually\nbecause that soul has helped him.\n“He wants people to know he’s not dead. He may have died\nphysically, but he’s not dead. \nThere is no death: that would be\nhis message now. He wants people to know that—there is no\ndeath.\n“ \nHe’s already emerging spiritually—he’s advancing in the\nspirit world, preparing for the day when he’ll come back with\ncomplete humility to serve in whatever manner he chooses.”\nBrother XII was certain that he would be remembered. “My\nwork will live,” he declared. His books and his writings consti-\ntute his legacy and deserve to be recognized as a significant\ncontribution to the literature of the occult. Had he lived up\nto his ideals, his work might be better known today. Still, he\n\nRule Thou the Shadow 357\nadded his own revelation of truth to that of the mystics and\nprophets who came before him—and those who will follow.\nThe events of Brother XII’s life reflect many of the mean-\nings of the twelfth house of astrology, traditionally the house of\nkarma and mystery. It is the house of self-undoing, imprison-\nment, bondage, secret enemies, sacrificial service and mystical\ninspiration. Representing the assimilation of all experience,\nit signifies completion, fulfillment, transformation—and ulti-\nmately, the transfiguration of the individual, nation and race.\nAs the house governing reincarnation, the twelfth house is\nsaid to be the one from which the future saviours of mankind\nwill spring. Brother XII’s life can be interpreted in the context\nof these various meanings.\nThe story of Brother XII is a dramatic example of the dangers\ninherent in following teachers who claim divine authority, and\nis a reminder of the vital need to distinguish between the true\nand the false prophet—and the often tragic consequences of a\nmistaken devotion to a religious leader. Ironically, Brother XII\nrepeatedly warned in his own writings against such a danger,\nteaching that man is his own Master and Saviour, and that the\ndisciple’s allegiance must be to the Higher Self.\nBrother XII was certainly one of the most remarkable reli-\ngious figures in recent history to exploit his knowledge of the\noccult to amass a personal fortune. Yet he was more than just\na fraud and an imposter. In spite of his personal failure, he\ngave eloquent expression to the spiritual truths upon which\nhe believed the foundations of the New Age would be built.\nThe message he proclaimed stands as a truth beyond his life,\nan ideal towards which people today can still aspire:\n“‘Give up thy life if thou would’st live,’ saith Wisdom.\nSurrender self. Thus shalt thou come to know thy true Self,\nwhich knows not birth nor death, but is eternal. Rule thou\nthe shadow—thine outer form; subdue its will to thine, the\nlower to the Higher. This is the way of Life.”\n\n358\nChart 1\nChart 2\n\n359\nThe Birthchart of Brother XII\nEdward Arthur Wilson\nborn July 25, 1878\nBirmingham, England\nCommentary by Zachary Casper\nN\no time is recorded for the birth of Brother XII.\nTherefore, the technique of the Solar Chart, cast for\nsunrise on July 25, 1878, is here employed (Chart 1).\nThe main feature of this horoscope is the stellium or cluster of\nfour planets, including the Sun, in the sign Leo. This is a fixed\nfire sign, giving self-assurance, dignity, leadership, and often\nspiritual aspiration. It is also a sign of self-indulgence and\npleasure. The aspects or angles which the Sun makes to other\nplanets is considered very important in any horoscope. Here,\nthe Sun is opposing Jupiter in Aquarius and squaring Neptune\nin Taurus; both of these aspects are considered difficult for\nthe expression of the higher side of the planetary energies\ninvolved. The Sun-Jupiter opposition gives enthusiasm and a\nfascination with religion, as well as an affinity for travel. It also\ndenotes recklessness and physical appetites which are difficult\nto control. According to \nAlan Oken’s Complete Astrology, the\nSun-Neptune square “usually becomes manifest as a liking for\n\n360 B R O T H E R X I I\nthe mystic, occult, and illusionary, but with a strong tendency\nto get lost along the path. More often, it represents a deceptive\nindividual, one who presents the most advantageous side\nof himself, while hiding his true nature and motivations.”\nIt is interesting to note that both Jupiter and Neptune are\nparticularly connected with religion, Jupiter in a formal way\nthrough churches and spiritual hierarchies; Neptune in a\nmore formless or mystic sense. These three planets form a\nconfiguration known as a “T-square,” which indicates mutual\ndifficulty.\nAnother outstanding feature of this chart is the conjunc-\ntion of three planets, Mars, Mercury, and Uranus in Leo. This\naspect gives incredible energy and drive, particularly in the\nmental sphere. Mercury, the planet of intelligence and the\nmind, receives the raw energy of Mars and is uplifted to a\nhigher plane of thinking by Uranus, the planet of the higher\nor superconscious mind. Alan Oken writes: “The individual is\ninventive, original, and very quick to arrive at a correct conclu-\nsion without necessarily having to analyze all the data. There is\na tendency, however, to be quite opinionated, and one is always\neager to express oneself in new and unusually unconventional\nways.” Uranus is said to rule occult studies and utopian ideals,\nincluding communal living.\nTwo planets were found in Gemini, the Moon and Venus.\nGemini is an air sign governing education, communication,\nand travel. The Moon here gives a personal liking for such\nactivities, particularly discussion and debate in which the indi-\nvidual is pleased to prove the correctness of his viewpoint and\nconvert the listener to his way of thinking. Thus, the power\nand self-assurance indicated by the Sun in Leo found a perfect\noutlet through the Gemini Moon for Brother XII to commu-\nnicate and persuade others to follow his particular views on\nlife. Venus in Gemini tends to give a desire for change and\nvariety in the love-life, which often manifests as short-lived\nrelationships.\nThe second chart (Chart 2) is cast for 1:00 PM., a time\n\nThe Birthchart of Brother XII 361\nchosen through intuition and experience as likely the most\ncorrect. Here, we find Scorpio rising, a sign said to rule the\nexperiences of sex, death, and regeneration, as well as giving\na strong interest in occult or mystic activities. Scorpio is a\nwater sign, befitting an individual who was a sea-captain. In\nthis chart, the Sun is found in the ninth house, which rules re-\nligion, philosophy, and journeys to foreign lands. The other\nLeo planets fall in the tenth house, the house of career, pro-\nfession, and public image. It is easy to understand why Brother\nXII became a leader. His ideas, Mercury, were expressed with\ngreat energy, Mars, and appealed to others through the higher\nmind, Uranus. No wonder his message found some public\nresponse.\nThe Moon and Venus in this chart are found in the eighth\nhouse, a house associated with Scorpio in astrological tra-\ndition. Besides expression of Scorpionic traits, the eighth\nhouse gives a talent for the management of other peoples’\nresources, apparently a specialty of Brother XII. We find in\nthe seventh house the two outermost planets, Neptune and\nPluto. The seventh house governs partnerships and marriage,\nand the presence of two of the most unusual planets here\nshows that his romantic liaisons were certainly of a different\norder than is the norm. Such planets, if well aspected, would\nindicate a partner of remarkable spiritual and evolutionary\npotential. However, as they are afflicted here, just the reverse\nis indicated. The squares formed by the Sun and Jupiter to\nNeptune have already been mentioned; Pluto as well is hor-\nribly afflicted, receiving squares from Mars, Mercury, and\nUranus. Thus, the power side of Pluto—sadism, revenge, and\nblack magic—would become manifest in his life through his\npartner.\nSaturn, the planet of self-discipline, restraint, and duty, is\nfound here below the horizon, in the fifth house, where it is\nrelatively weak. Saturn in the sign Aries is said to be in its fall;\nthus the potential good qualities of patience, perseverance,\nand forbearance would not manifest easily. However, Saturn\n\n362 B R O T H E R X I I\nforms some extremely good aspects to other planets, such as\na trine to the Sun and sextiles to the Moon and Jupiter, which\nindicate the possibility of discipline and simplicity manifesting\nin the life. Seen in a more occult sense, the good aspects of\nSaturn represent rewards reaped from previous lifetimes of\ndecent living. Unfortunately, the weak position of Saturn was\nultimately not able to overcome the Leonian traits of self-ag-\ngrandizement and indulgence in pleasure. Also, the Moon’s\nSouth Node, indicator of activities performed in past life-\ntimes, is here found in Leo in the midheaven. This shows that\nLeo tendencies were brought over from the past in a strong\nmanner and would prove difficult to control. The power of\na Leo personality often proves overbearing unless there are\nplanets in Virgo to give discrimination or Libra to give bal-\nance, which are absent in this chart.\nThe problem in this horoscope is that there are too many\nplanets in fixed signs: Leo, Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius.\nThese signs give strength, determination, and perseverance,\nbut they need to be balanced by planets in mutable signs,\nwhich give intelligence, introspection, and analysis. There are\nonly two mutable-sign planets found here. Cardinal or active\nsigns give the necessary activity for the release of energy in a\nconstructive way, but only one is found here. This horoscope\nis somewhat reminiscent of that of Benito Mussolini. Like the\nItalian dictator, Brother XII too came to an inglorious end, with\nmany heavy karmic debts to be repaid in future lifetimes.\n\n363\nPostscript\nT\nhe waves slapped against the sides of the boat as we\ndrifted alongside the eerily eroded cliffs on the south\nside of DeCourcy Island. Scrambling ashore, we\nclimbed up a sandstone path to the deserted farm where little\nhad changed in the decades since Brother XII’s disciples had\nplowed the fields and tended their vegetable gardens in the\nhot summer sun. It was the fall of 2000 and I was accompa-\nnied by James A. Santucci, Professor of Comparative Religion\nat California State University in Fullerton, and a camera crew\nheaded by award-winning filmmaker David Cherniack, who was\nshooting an hour-long television documentary about Brother\nXII. Over the next several days, we explored the former haunts\nof the colony’s leader at DeCourcy, Valdes Island and Cedar-\nby-the-Sea, revisiting the legend of Brother XII and mulling\nover the implications of his story for our time. Santucci had\nwritten the first detailed account of Edward Arthur Wilson’s\nactivities in his article, “The Aquarian Foundation,” published\nin 1989 in the academic journal, \nCommunal Societies, having\nbeen intrigued by newspaper clippings about Brother XII that\nhe’d discovered in the files of Henry N. Stokes, editor of the\nOriental & Esoteric Library Critic. One of the foremost scholars\n\n364 B R O T H E R X I I\nstudying the Theosophical movement and the rise of new re-\nligions, Santucci was eminently qualified to place Brother XII\nin the proper historical context and to provide insight into his\ncharacter and behaviour in relation to other cult figures he\nhad studied. As we inspected the forlorn shell of the House of\nMystery, rummaged through the tumbledown remains of the\ncolony’s dilapidated structures, and examined the remnants\nof a stone fort that had once protected Brother XII’s house\nat DeCourcy, we reflected on what, in the words of former\nadherent Edward Lucas, this “little brown leaf of a man with\na large heart and a rare spirit” had accomplished, what had\ngone wrong and why.\nThere are conflicting views about Brother XII. Some people\nconsider him to have been a charlatan from the outset, a de-\nvious mountebank intent on duping his gullible followers;\nothers cut him considerably more slack, holding the view that\nhe was a genuine prophet and mystic who was derailed in his\nmission, someone more to be pitied than condemned. In his\nreview in BC BookWorld of the original edition of this book,\nthe respected man of letters George Woodcock observed that\nat the heart of the story there was “a malign core shining as\ndarkly as a poison-filled Borgia jewel,” while Alexander Blair-\nEwart, the editor and publisher of the magazine \nDimensions,\nwas more sympathetic, regarding Brother XII as an initiate\nwho had succumbed to the perils of messianic delusion, his\nwork subverted by negative forces of a greater magnitude\nthan he could transform: “There will come a time when all of\nthese failed messiahs will be seen for what they really are—the\nfrontiersmen and women at the boundary of the New Age,\noverwhelmed and tragic martyrs who dared great things in a\ntime of troubles, all of them doomed to become the opposite\nof themselves and afterwards live with the shame and pain of\nhaving failed themselves, their vision and their followers.”\nAs I discussed such issues with Santucci, he pointed out\nthat Brother XII possessed all the characteristics of the \nmagus\nor civilized shaman; his ecstatic experiences appeared legit-\n\nPostscript 365\nimate, as evidenced in Foundation Letters and Teachings, and\nhis purported contact with supernatural beings was an age-old\nphenomenon and didn’t discredit him. Scientific studies of\nchanneling have shown actual physiological changes taking\nplace in the brains of mediums, he added, which made me\nwonder: was some part of Brother XII’s brain overshadowing\nhis personality when he was in trance or was a separate discar-\nnate entity indeed speaking through him?\nOn Valdes Island, James and I walked up the hill to the former\nsite of the Mandieh Settlement, where Brother XII’s soul mate\nMyrtle Baumgartner had lived in the fall of 1928. We paused\nto admire the idyllic views of the Strait of Georgia framed by\npine trees and to savor the beauty of the spot that she found\nso comforting during her sojourn on the Island. Myrtle is un-\ndoubtedly the most tragic individual in the Brother XII story;\nshe suffered two miscarriages and nearly lost her mind in the\nprocess, yet she becomes an even more poignant figure when\none reads the letters she wrote to her estranged husband, and\nrealizes how deeply she loved Brother XII. The letters, which\nwere only discovered after the initial publication of this book,\nwere included as exhibits in the divorce proceedings that her\nhusband brought against her, as she’d made no attempt to\nconceal the fact that she’d committed adultery; rather, the let-\nters were her attempt to explain why she’d been impelled to\ndo so. She wrote that as early as 1920, she saw the man whom\nshe would later recognize as Brother XII in her dreams. In\none particularly memorable dream, she was crossing a long\nand exposed bridge and battling cold and cruel winds as she\nattempted to reach a figure waiting for her on the other side:\n“I made little progress, but in the face of almost insuperable\nodds, I kept right on because \nhe was waiting and I must reach\nhim.”\nI awoke with the firm conviction that somewhere the\ntrue one was awaiting me, and in my mind’s eye, I had a\n\n366 B R O T H E R X I I\nvery clear picture of his appearance. At intervals, I dreamed\nof him again. Then in 1922 came my long and wonderful\nEgyptian dream—and this same man again figured promi-\nnently in the dream. I knew that I never really loved anyone\nbut \nhim —but it never occurred to me that he was on earth\nin physical embodiment. From 1922 onward, the contact\nin night consciousness was almost constant. My dream life\nbecame my real life, and while I had my outer life and my\nouter love and outer duties, they truly seemed a means to\nan end—a ladder upon which I must climb to stand on the\nmountain top with \nhim.\nMyrtle added that she knew that the man she met nightly\nwas her “Beloved” because “there was between us a rhythmic\nelectric bliss when in each other’s presence that simply left\none spellbound, and which when once experienced left ab-\nsolutely no room for doubt. When you have come into the\npresence of that one—once—you will never again wonder—\nyou will \nknow.”\nMyrtle claimed that Brother XII was “the one true mate cre-\nated with me, the only one in all the universe to whom I am\ntruly married,” and said that the two of them had used their\nenergy to help her husband overcome his illness, rejoicing\nwhen he’d done so. She reiterated that she still loved him, but\nit wasn’t “the great love,” adding, “And while I love you very\ndearly, Eddie, and my heart yearns over you daily, I know and\nhave known for years that my love for you was maternal. That\nis why it did not satisfy you.”\nMyrtle went on to describe her initial meeting with Brother\nXII as follows:\nThen in 1926 came a great dedication to the service\nof humanity, taken also in my night consciousness. This\ngreat service was a joint service which I undertook with this\nBeloved One, with whom I had been in contact for years.\nEven yet, though, I did not know he was in physical em-\n\nPostscript 367\nbodiment. Now for the great experience. Upon my arrival\nat the A.F. Headquarters, I was met at the boat by Coulson\nTurnbull, and an hour or so later ushered into an office\nwhere—well, I can hardly speak of it—I saw walking to meet\nme this One. I gasped and the expression on his face was\nof as intense a surprise. It was reunion, and no power on\nearth, no personality, no principality, no consideration can\nsever us twain. I \nknow. I know and he knows—our experi-\nences have been identical. We both know of the service of\ndedication to a joint work; we took it together, are fully con-\nscious of all that it entails, and that work is going forward\nregardless of who individually suffers.\nAt the time, Myrtle never dreamed of the heartache she\nwould subsequently suffer. To what degree she was mistreated\nor spurned by Brother XII remains unknown, yet three\nmonths after writing these words, she wired her husband: “If\nyou will have me back, may I come? Heartsore and weary.”\nMyrtle’s attempt at reconciliation was cruelly rebuffed; her\nembittered husband ripped the telegram in half before re-\nplying, “\nAbsolutely no!”\nMyrtle’s letters reveal that Brother XII was evidently telling\nthe truth when he said that he met Myrtle for the first time when\nshe visited the Foundation headquarters, although Robert\nEngland testified in court that he’d told him he’d met Myrtle\non the train between Seattle and Chicago, a meeting immor-\ntalized in \nThe Vancouver Province headline: “OSIRIS AND ISIS\nMET ON TRAIN BETWEEN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO.”\nThat encounter, which is such an integral part of the Brother\nXII story, was reiterated in England’s damning letter to Wilson\nand in affidavits filed by the dissenting Governors, seeking to\nhave the Foundation dissolved, so there seemed no reason\nto doubt it, despite Wilson’s denial, until the discovery of\nMyrtle’s letters. Did England simply get it wrong, making a\nmistake that became enshrined as fact over time? Apparently\nso, though it also seems unlikely, as he was an acute observer,\n\n368 B R O T H E R X I I\na detail-oriented person by nature and by virtue of his pro-\nfessional training. One possibility is that Brother XII lied to\nEngland about the circumstances of the couple’s meeting,\nmaking it appear to be a far more glamorous liaison than it\nreally was in order to justify the controversial affair. Or could\nMyrtle have intentionally deceived her husband in a key\ndetail in the letter? The divorce papers confirm that Brother\nXII and Myrtle were together in Chicago, subsequently re-\nturning to Cedar, which is why the disciples dubbed her, “The\nMagdalene from Chicago.”\nThe most likely explanation for the historical confusion is\nthat England was indeed mistaken; Myrtle initially met Brother\nXII at Cedar, subsequently traveling with him to Chicago to\nattend the Third Party convention, and later returning with\nhim to the settlement, where her presence was kept a secret.\nIn this second edition of the book, I have chosen to leave the\nscene on the train as it stands, since so many of the individuals\nin the narrative were operating under this assumption con-\ncerning the meeting of Brother XII and Myrtle, while pointing\nout in this postscript that the event likely differed from that\ndescribed. Though the pair’s romantic liaison during a trans-\ncontinental train journey was part of the Brother XII legend\nfor years, the discovery of Myrtle’s letters illustrates how easily\nan inadvertent error can lead to a version of history that may\nbe significantly different from the reality of actual events.\nBrother XII’s abandonment of Myrtle in the aftermath of\nher failure to produce the next World Teacher undoubtedly\ncontributed to her emotional collapse, yet his actions in the sit-\nuation foreshadowed his later mistreatment of Mary Connally\nand the other disciples who had placed their trust in him.\nHow could the same man who had written, “Thoughts, if they\nare to reach the hearts of men, must be borne upon the wings\nof Love,” end up conducting midnight rituals in the cabin of\nthe \nLady Royal in an attempt to assassinate his enemies?\nYet as Jim Santucci and I discussed such matters with\nDavid Cherniack during the making of the documentary, I\n\nPostscript 369\nfound myself asking: did he really change? Or was he always a\nshort-tempered, volatile individual who could twist off at the\nslightest provocation? The earliest example of Wilson’s erratic\nbehaviour was in England in 1926 when his application to\njoin the Buddhist Lodge of London under the name “Brother\nXII,” rather than his ordinary name, was refused. According\nto Buddhist scholar Christmas Humphreys, “He replied like a\nsmall school-boy in a huff,” while Harry J. Strutton, editor of\nThe Occult Review, writing of Brother XII’s exploits in hind-\nsight, said that he’d detected in Wilson “a latent wildness and\ninstability, which, to say the least, were disconcerting.”\nStrutton added that prior to Brother XII’s departure for\nCanada, persons he declined to name had made efforts to\nhave him certified insane. The insanity issue continued to\nshadow Wilson, for the workmen employed to construct the\nsettlement wondered at times if he was mentally unbalanced,\nsince he would give contradictory orders and erupt into a\nrage over the smallest thing. And at one point, the dissenting\nGovernors considered trying to have him committed, though\nEdward Lucas later apologized in a letter, using his affec-\ntionate term for his former friend, “If I have thought the Old\nMan was loony and finally up and said so—well, I suppose that\nis a way mates have.”\nFollowing Brother XII’s return to the colony from England\nin 1930, his episodes of bizarre behaviour, rages and para-\nnoia increased in frequency and intensity, culminating in the\nfrightening image invoked by Annie Barley at the 1933 court\nproceedings of a demented leader standing with his fist in\nthe air cursing his cringing disciples until he couldn’t speak\nanymore: “He would go back trembling to the house with his\nvoice gone and that was the occurrence ten times a day, pretty\nnearly every day.”\nHow does one explain such behaviour? Was it caused by\ndrugs or by an incipient insanity? Could there be a darker, un-\nsuspected reason for these debilitating attacks?\n\n374 B R O T H E R X I I\nas a result, they deserved nothing. So he gave them nothing—\nand disappeared.”\nBrother XII’s disciples were surprisingly forgiving of their\nleader. Mary Connally mourned the change in Wilson, de-\nclaring, “If the Brother would only come back and be his old\nself, we would be only too glad to join with him again, and\nforget the past,” while Alfred Barley observed in a letter to\nThe Occult Review that Brother XII’s “fatal course of action in\ndirect contravention of everything he had written shall result\nin having educated us into a realization of those truths which\nbefore had been but words on paper.”\nIf one reads Brother XII’s works in their entirety, one is\nstruck by the authority with which he writes and by the clarity\nand precision of his prose. The disciples who accepted him as\ntheir teacher believed that he possessed the knowledge and\nwisdom that he so eloquently expressed; though disillusioned,\nmany continued to regard him as having the spiritual power\nand insight that he claimed. Truth itself did not change, he\nwrote in one of his monthly Instructions, only the forms into\nwhich it was poured, and through which it was imperfectly ex-\npressed from age to age:\nOnly the Wise may know the mystery of the Cycle: birth,\ngrowth, maturity, decay, death—which is but birth into an-\nother section of the Cycle—so turns the wheel. He who\nimagines the last word spoken, the final revelation made, is\nyet far from \nthe beginning of Wisdom. It is only with these or\nsimilar thoughts in mind that we may hope to approach the\nMysteries. Such thoughts must flow into the mind uncon-\nsciously and without effort; their Source is in That which\nis above mind and below it, and from Which mind itself\nis born—the worlds of reality, the Gateway to the Temple\nof the Mysteries. Man is born of woman, lives out the fret\nof life and passes on. Nations rise and fall, creeds blossom\nand decay, Teachers and Messengers arise, serve and pass\nto further service. Men are left with three things—the tra-\n\nPostscript 375\ndition of the past, the hope of the future, and the work of\ntoday. The last is the sum and substance of the other two.\nOnly Eternal Truth endures. Creeds and religions are but\nthe man-projected shadows of Its light. From It all comes,\nto It all returns—It is at once the Source, the Sustenance,\nthe Goal.\nBrother XII’s story is a cautionary tale that foreshadows the\nvarious cult tragedies that have occurred in recent decades.\nHe was not just a parlour mystic or armchair theoretician,\nbut someone who possessed real occult and mystical power.\nHe was a maverick and rebel, a man of action who fearlessly\ntackled contentious social issues and waded into politics with a\nvengeance. His intensely dramatic life proved once again that\ntruth is stranger than fiction. Yet as he himself observed, initi-\nation is a quaking path to travel and failure is the rule, rather\nthan the exception. Like so many others who followed him,\nhis utopia crashed on the rock of personality, though the best\nof his writings still shine with a light uniquely their own and\nwill no doubt find an audience again.\nLike the restless wanderer of Tennyson’s poem “Ulysses,”\nBrother XII sought new worlds, voyaging to the farthest\nshores of consciousness, his gods, the ancient deities, his dis-\nembodied Master, his guide. It is a curious tale, admittedly,\nbut the figure at the center of it can now be more fully under-\nstood by a new generation of readers and by all those who find\nthemselves drawn to the power of that strange and singular in-\ndividual the world knows as Brother XII.",
