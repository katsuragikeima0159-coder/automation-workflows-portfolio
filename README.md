Alexander Ledesma Workflow Automations


This repository contains sample automation workflows I’ve built using **n8n**, API integrations, and general automation best practices.  
All workflows have been sanitized and simplified to remove sensitive client data while keeping the logic and structure intact.

These examples demonstrate my hands-on experience in:

- Building multi-step automations  
- Creating workflow logic for business processes  
- Integrating APIs (GET/POST)  
- Processing data and routing conditions  
- Automating lead-flow and operational tasks  
- Using workflow tools like **n8n**, Make.com (similar concepts)
